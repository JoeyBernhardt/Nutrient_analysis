Juveniles are found over soft substrates in shallow and sheltered coastal waters. They are often found over seagrass (e.g. <i>Posidonia</i> species) beds in mangrove-lined (<i>Avicennia</i> species) creeks (Ref. 27967). They can tolerate temperature and salinity extremes, such as those found in gulfs in South Australia and the Coorong. Larger fish move into exposed, coastal waters, such as around rocky headlands, near reefs and the surf zone (Ref. 6390). Juveniles of 4-6 cm FL appear in shallow, sheltered Tasmanian waters between January and September (Ref. 6390).
Juveniles feed on zooplankton and epibenthic species of fish, squid, crustaceans and polychaete worms (Ref. 27967). They exhibit diel and seasonal diet shift which may be related to changes in the availability of prey (Ref. 27967). In New Zealand, adults appear to change their diet from planktonic crustaceans when they are less than 10 cm in length to fishes when larger (Ref. 27967), according to a study conducted by Baker (1971). Competitive interactions between its closest relative,<i>Arripis truttaceus</i>, may also be a factor in the seasonal dietary shifts.

Fish prey becomes more common in the diet with increasing body size (Refs. 1371, 89387). Adults may cover large distances during the feeding period (Ref. 89387). 
Young cod are also preyed upon by different fish species and octopus. Adult cod are prey items of top predators like sharks, rays, whales, dolphins, seals, and sea birds (Refs. 9023, 9581, 26954, 43651, 45735).
In the Baltic it grows up to 5 kg weight in 7-8 years; in the North Sea it reaches 8 kg in the same time span . Natural mortality for adults of both stocks is assumed to be around M=0.2, resulting in a mean adult life expectancy and mean duration of the reproductive phase of 5 years (Ref. 88171).

In some areas such as Shark Bay and the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, adults live in marine waters throughout the year.  This behaviour seems to occur only where estuarine and freshwater habitats are limited (Ref. 28722).  A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).  Migrating sea mullet do not feed during either the 'hardgut' migration or spawning migration (Ref. 6390).  Feed on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, microalgae, and detritus (Ref. 11889).  Undergo ontogenic shift in diet (Ref. 41769).  Small mullet (< 4 cm SL) feed exclusively on sediment by browsing.  Large mullet (< 4 cm SL) have been observed to feed by grazing on the sediment (Ref. 41769).  Changes in the feeding habits from planktonic organisms and migratory zooplankton to meiobenthos which takes place between 0.1 and 0.2 cm length, and a switch from meiobenthos to microbenthos between 0.15 and 0.25 cm length (Ref. 56101).  Sea mullet normally feed close to the river bed in shallow water, but do move throughout the water column in river channels and individuals often jump high out of the water (Ref. 6390).  Sea mullet have a strong tendency to school as juveniles and during the spawning season as adults.  Feeding schools of juveniles commonly disperse over sand and mud flats of estuaries during high tide and reform on the ebb tide (Ref. 28722).  Presence of sharp pointed teeth  that enable the species to select fine material (Ref. 74863).
In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).  Has a short, well-defined juvenile recruitment period; although found in freshwater, occurs in far greater numbers in all areas of estuaries and is common in the sea (Ref. 74748, 74749).  Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,"1997-04-08 00:00:00 +0000",309,"2007-07-31 00:00:00 +0000",NA,NA,NA,243

The migration route in the Gulf of Thailand has been mapped (Ref. 6783). Feeding apparently occurs day and night.
In north Queensland, small juveniles up to 10 m FL live in creeks, estuaries and along areas of sheltered mud flats in the early wet season (December-January) (Ref. 30194).

Albacore tend to concentrate along thermal discontinuities such as the Transition Zone in the north Pacific and the Kuroshio Front east of Japan because of richer forage organisms but poorer in oxygen content. Albacore migrate within water masses rather than across temperature and oxygen boundaries. Minimum oxygen requirements are probably about 2 ml/l. At least two stocks (northern and southern) are believed to exist in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Feed during the day and at night (diurnal and nocturnal).
The migration pattern of albacore in the south Pacific Ocean has recently been described (Ref. 30272). Juveniles move from the tropics into temperate waters and then eastwards along the subtropical convergence zone. At maturity, albacore return to the tropics but go back to temperate waters after spawning (Ref. 6390).
In Australian waters, larvae are present on the North West shelf all summer, but are present off north-eastern Australia mainly between October and December (Ref. 30274). Juveniles are found off New South Wales from September to November, and during summer they follow the warmer waters of the East Australian Current southwards (Ref. 6390). Albacore may reach eastern Tasmanian waters by December, where they remain until about April (Ref. 6390). As autumn approaches and warm waters recede, the juveniles move northwards and are present again off New South Wales until May (Ref. 30278). Adult albacore travel in independent, small groups (Ref. 30273), and are common throughout much of the species' range (Ref. 6390).

In the northeastern Pacific, they tend to migrate northward along the coast of Baja California and California, USA from June to September. Off the Pacific coast of Japan they migrate northward in summer and southward during winter. Large fish may enter the Sea of Japan from the south in early summer and move as far north as the Okhotsk Sea, most leave the Sea of Japan through Tsugara Strait, north of Honshu. Variations in the food spectrum are attributed primarily to behavioral differences in feeding: 'vigorous pursuit' would be required on small schooling fishes (anchovies, sauries, hakes) or on squids, while 'modified filter-feeding' is used to feed on red crabs and other less agile organisms (Ref. 168).

In southeastern Australian waters, sharp temperature and salinity gradients across oceanic fronts provide favourable conditions for concentrations of broadbill swordfish (Ref. 6390).  Little is known of large scale movements by adult broadbill swordfish. Mature fish make only limited local movements (Ref. 9742). Tracking of fish using acoustic tags has shown that broadbill swordfish typically move to surface waters at night and inhabit deeper waters during the day, reaching depths up to 600 m (Ref. 30447). These vertical movements may be rapid and involve changes in waters temperature as great as 19°C (Ref. 6390). Some tagged fish spend daylight hours near the sea bed close to the continental shelf break or submerged banks and move offshore at night (Ref. 6390). In the eastern Pacific broadbill swordfish are commonly seen basking at the sea surface for short periods during the day, a behaviour that may allow the fish to recover from stress associated with low temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in deep water (Ref. 30447). Broadbill swordfish are normally solitary, but pairs of fish are regularly observed at the surface off the Californian coast (Ref. 30447).
Larvae are most common within a few m of the surface during the day but may move to depths of 30 m at night (Ref. 30448). Swordfish larvae longer than 10 mm feed almost exclusively on larvae of other fish species (Ref. 6390).  Young swordfish is preyed upon by blue shark, tuna and marlins.  Parasites of the species include a cestode, <i>Fistulicola plicatus</i>; trematode, <i>Tristoma</i> spp.; monogenean, <i>Tristoma coccineum</i>and <i>T. integrum</i>; nematode, <i>Thynnascaris incurva</i> and a copepod, <i>Pennella filosa</i> (Ref. 5951).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"1991-06-10 00:00:00 +0000",309,"2008-07-01 00:00:00 +0000",711,"2001-11-21 00:00:00 +0000",NA,226
