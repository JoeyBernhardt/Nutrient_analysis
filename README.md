#### Nutrient_analysis

Hi Mary!


For our Nov 13 meeting, please check out:

* This [blog post](http://www.r-bloggers.com/on-functional-diversity-metrics/), which compares different FD approaches.

* Owen Petchey's [advice](http://www.thetrophiclink.org/resources/calculating-fd/) and [code](https://github.com/opetchey/ttl-resources/tree/master/functional_diversity) for calculating FD.

* This [fundiv package](https://github.com/ibartomeus/fundiv), which supposedly  helps compare the two approaches.

* Let's discuss the main differences between distance based metrics of FD and space based approaches, and which is more appropriate for the type of data I have...i.e. some very small 'species richness' values for some countries. Or should I just try both and compare?

* Finally, let's talk about some other ways of getting at functional redundancy, ie. something akin to rarefaction curves? See this [paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00178.x/asset/j.2041-210X.2011.00178.x.pdf;jsessionid=7F185D0F8E4890891857EB8C60F53497.f01t04?v=1&t=igwds46p&s=20739ebd17f769aa704a0a6822b7575ac8413968)





For our Nov 6 meeting, please check out:

* This [paper](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2244.1) by Laliberte and Legendre which describes the [FD](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FD/index.html) package and approach.


* [rfishbase](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase)

* my [attempts](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/Nutrient_analysis/tree/master/Functional_Diversity) at calculating nutritional FD, inspired by this [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021235) about nutritional diversity in African agricultural systems.





#### What's in this repo?
(an attempt at organizing things!)

Code for plots and figures in the trait nutrient paper.
