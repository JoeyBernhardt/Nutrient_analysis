#### Nutrient_analysis

Hi Mary!


For our Nov 6 meeting, please check out:

* This [paper](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2244.1) by Laliberte and Legendre which describes the [FD](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FD/index.html) package and approach.


* [rfishbase](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase)

* my [attempts](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/Nutrient_analysis/tree/master/Functional_Diversity) at calculating nutritional FD, inspired by this [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021235) about nutritional diversity in African agricultural systems.





#### What's in this repo?
(an attempt at organizing things!)

Code for plots and figures in the trait nutrient paper.
