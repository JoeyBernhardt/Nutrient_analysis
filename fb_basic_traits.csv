Adults are usually found in open waters along the coast (Ref. 51442). In freshwater, inhabits major rivers but may also enter tributaries, if water  temperature is equal to or is warmer than the main river (Ref. 188, 10536). Known lake populations from Morocco and Portugal need access to rivers to spawn (Refs. 10536, 89647, 89648). Larvae and small juveniles inhabit deep slow-flowing areas of rivers (Ref. 89649), some swimming upstream in late summer and autumn (Ref. 10536). Juveniles (up to 1+ years) are usually found near estuaries or river mouths (Refs. 10536, 59043), possibly making vertical diurnal movements synchronized with the tides; they remain in estuaries for over one year (Ref. 89630). Feeds on a wide range of planktonic crustaceans; larger adults feed on small schooling fishes (Ref. 188, 51442, 59043). Juveniles in freshwater prey on insect larvae. Females in European rivers commonly reach 70 cm total length (Ref. 10536). Females grow faster and are always larger than males of the same age (Ref. 10536). Less common than <i>Alosa fallax</i> but both have suffered from pollution and weirs or other obstructions (Ref. 188). It has been suggested that members of the genus <i>Alosa</i> are hearing specialists with the American shad (<i>Alosa sapidissima</i>) having been found to detect and respond to sounds up to at least 180 kHz (Ref. 89631). This may aid in predator avoidance (e.g. cetaceans) (Ref. 89632). Hybridization with the twaite shad (<i>Alosa fallax</i>) has been reported from the Rhine (Ref. 89633) as well as from rivers in France and Algeria (Ref. 10536).

Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712). Obvious decreasing of the stocks for all the continental native distribution area (Ref. 40476). Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; can be fried, boiled and baked (Ref. 9988).

From just upstream Phnom Penh in Cambodia to the Khone Falls this species is reported to migrate upstream during the period October-February.  At Muk Kompul in Kandal Province, it migrates upstream just before the full moon.  Further upstream near Kratie, migration occurs during full moon and at Sambor, migration takes place immediately after full moon.  Near the Khone Falls, upstream movements continue through March but in April fish are moving in both direction.  From May to July, at the start of the rainy season, it migrates downstream from the Khone Falls to the Mekong Delta.  Here, the fish is reported to move out of the Mekong into canals and  flooded areas in August-September.  When water recedes in November-December, fish migrates to the Mekong again.  Upstream the Khone Falls near Ubolratchatani in Thailand, this species moves upstream between February and June, consisting mainly of juveniles in February-March and of adults (15-20 cm)  in April-June.

Isotope analysis has shown that shortfin mako is the highest level fish predator in oceanic waters off eastern Australia (Ref. 86961).  Adults feed on bony fishes, other sharks (Ref. 5578), cephalopods; larger individuals may feed on larger prey such as billfish and small cetaceans (Ref. 6871, 58048).

Gestation period lasts 15-18 months, spawning cycle is every 3 years.  Some authors (Refs. 1661, 28081, 31395) have erroneously assumed that two age rings are deposited per year by this species, thus underestimating longevity, age at maturity, and resilience . These data have been removed and replaced by recent, verified estimates (Refs. 86586, 86587, 86588).  Tagging in New Zealand indicates seasonal migrations (Ref. 26346).  The presence of genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA across global populations (Ref. 36416) suggests dispersal may be male-biased, and that females may have natal site-fidelity.  Shortfin mako has been shown to have a marked sexually segregated population structure (Ref. 86954).  
Shortfin mako is probably the fastest of all sharks and can leap out of the water when hooked (Ref. 6871).  Potentially dangerous and responsible for unprovoked attacks on swimmers and boats (Ref. 13574).  Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; eaten broiled and baked (Ref. 9988).

Pelagic, epipelagic or littoral shark. Highly migratory, moves generally along the continental shelves. Specimens tagged off southern England were recaptured in northern Norway (having travelled 2,370 km), Denmark and Spain (Ref. 88752, 88753). The northwest Atlantic stock migrates from Newfoundland, Canada in the winter to Massachusetts in the summer (Ref. 43278, 88754). Trans-Atlantic migrations have also been recorded. One of the most cold-tolerant sharks; in the northwest Atlantic mostly found from 5-10°C (Ref. 88755). Known to temporarily tolerate salinities as low as 10 to follow its prey (Ref. 88740). Found singly and in schools and feeding aggregations (Ref. 247). Feeds on small and medium-sized pelagic schooling species, other sharks, squid (Ref. 5578) and demersal fishes (cod, white hake, red hake, haddock and cusk (Ref. 5951, 43278)). Ovoviviparous species (Ref. 43278, 50449). Females grow larger than males (Ref. 88756). Catch records and studies in the northeast Atlantic show segregation by sex and size (Ref. 56108, 88756, 88757). Parasites include <i>Phyllobothrium dagnallium</i> (found in stomach, intestine and spiral valve) and <i>Dinobothrium</i> sp. (Ref. 5951). Regarded as potentially dangerous to people because of its size and activity but has never or very seldom been indicted in an attack on people or boats (Ref. 247). Excellent sportfish (Ref. 84357). The flesh of the porbeagle is of good quality and texture and is said to taste like swordfish (Ref. 84357). Utilized fresh, dried or salted and frozen for human consumption; for oil and fishmeal; fins for shark-fin soup (Ref. 247). May be pan-fried and broiled (Ref. 9988).",NA,0.7813,0,23,1992-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,2189,2011-11-25T20:58:19.000Z,2,1994-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,NA,88

There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).  The sockeye is one of the most commercially important Pacific salmons; the kokanee is primarily a sport fish but also makes excellent food and in some areas well regarded as food for large trout (Ref. 27547).

Juveniles live in shallow coastal waters and estuaries (Ref. 57574), which are also the summer feeding grounds for the adults (Ref. 30193).  Juveniles of less than a year old feed on plankton and larvae of insects, juveniles of more than a year and adults feed on benthic fauna (Ref. 51442), including small fishes and invertebrates (Ref. 30193).  Nocturnal and burrowing (Ref. 30193).  Marketed fresh and frozen; can be steamed, fried, boiled, microwaved and baked (Ref. 9988).  Worms and mollusks are excellent baits for line fishing (Ref. 30578).",NA,0.75,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,2,2014-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,97,2003-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,NA,1341

Under laboratory conditions it is an obligatory air breather (Ref. 34291), but under certain conditions lungfish in the wild may not be obligate air breathers and the use of aerial respiration may be a function of ecological as well as physiological factors (Ref. 58531).",NA,0.6602,0,1,1994-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,2,2014-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,34,1994-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,NA,8734

Although lake trout generally feed on a variety of organisms such as freshwater sponges, crustaceans, insects, fishes (with a preference for ciscoes), and small mammals, some populations feed on plankton throughout their lives (Ref. 27547).  Such plankton-feeding lake trout grow more slowly, mature earlier and at smaller size, die sooner and attain smaller maximum size than do their fish-eating counterparts (Ref. 30351).  Lake trout are highly susceptible to pollution, especially from insecticides (Ref. 14019, 27547).

An inshore and offshore dogfish of the continental and insular shelf and upper slopes (Ref. 247, 11230). Usually near the bottom, but also in midwater and at the surface (Ref. 26346); occurs mainly between 10-200 m depth (Ref. 247). Males and gravid females usually found shallower than non-gravid females. Tolerates brackish water, often found in enclosed bays and estuaries. Reported to enter freshwater (Ref. 11980) but cannot survive there for more than a few hours (Ref. 247). Highly migratory species, used to be observed in large foraging schools with up to thousands of individuals, usually segregated by size and /or sex, with schools of large gravid females preferentially targeted by fisheries. Their latitudinal (north-south) and depth-related (nearshore-offshore) movements appear to be correlated with their preferred temperature (Ref. 247). Tagging experiments showed that populations in the northern North Sea and northwest Scotland made winter migrations to off Norway and summer migrations to Scotland (Ref. 88880, 88881). Transoceanic migrations recorded, but rare (Ref. 88864). Longevity in the northern Atlantic is about 35-50 years (Ref. 88882), but most live only 20-24 years (Ref. 88187). Growth is slow. At sexual maturity, males are 60-70 cm long, females 75-90 cm (Ref. 35388). Gestation period is 2 years (Ref. 36731). Ovoviviparous (Ref. 205). Feeds on a diversity of prey, ranging from comb jellyfish, squid, mackarel and herring to a wide array of benthic fishes, shrimps, crabs and even sea cucumbers (Ref. 93252). The only species of horned sharks that can inflict toxins with its tail. Detects weak electric fields generated by potential prey (Ref. 10311).

They are traded as fresh fish, boneless flesh, in frozen blocks or as Surimi.  The fish is cooked in the microwave, steamed or fried in butter (Ref. 9988).

Adults feed mainly on higher plants and also algae, insects and crustaceans.  Make excellent eating (Ref. 5214).","<b>Scientific name</b>: <i>Tilapia rendalli</i> Boulenger, 1897.
 <p>
The literature on this species has references to three subspecies:  <i>T. ren. rendalli</i>, <i>T. ren. swierstrae</i>, and <i>T. ren. gefuensis</i> (see Thys van den Audenaerde 1968).  These subspecific names are not universally agreed and are not commonly found in the literature on aquaculture of this species.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is one of  a group of several substrate-spawning tilapias that were formerly called ‘<i>Tilapia melanopleura</i>’ by some authors. <i> T. melanopleura</i> is no longer a valid name.  Trewavas (1982) has described the problems caused by previous inaccurate nomenclature of this and related species and listed the characteristics that distinguish <i>T. rendalli</i> from other species which it was sometimes confused.
 <p>
<b>Common Names</b>: Red Breasted Tilapia, Mudile (Tonga), Rooiborskurper (Afrikaans), Chilunguni (Chichewa).
 <p>
<b>History of Use</b>: A popular foodfish throughout subSaharan Africa. Probably first cultured experimentally in Zaïre in the late 1930’s and established in smallholder ponds in that country by 1947. Although now largely abandoned in Zaïre in favor of other species, still widely cultured by African smallholders for subsistence in low-input systems.
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b>: 843 tons reported to FAO in 1995 from Malawi, Zambia, Colombia, and Dominican Republic. Other countries that farm this tilapia combine population statistics with those for tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
<b>Where Farmed</b>: West, Central and, particularly, Southern Africa. According to Coche et al (1994), <i>T. rendalli</i> is the fourth most widely cultured species reported in a recent sample of  subSaharan African countries. Countries reporting farmed <i>T. rendalli</i> production are: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
 <p>
<b>Climate and Environmental Tolerance</b>: tropics, can withstand temperatures of 10-40° C. Spawns at temperatures above 20 and of up to at least 30° C. For juveniles, which often forage in very shallow littoral areas, Caulton (1976) demonstrated a temperature preferendum of 35-37° Reported to survive salinities of 13, 18 and 26 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current Farming Methods</b>: Commercially produced in a cage-based system in Mazvikadei Dam, Zimbabwe; otherwise in small ponds generally of no more than 550 m2. Can support commercial fisheries when stocked into managed reservoirs. Pond inputs are green, leafy materials which are readily eaten by <i>T. rendalli</i> of over 20 g.  Smaller individuals are largely omnivorous.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is a voracious feeder and can consume up to 20% of its body weight per day in fresh green materials. A range of plants suitable for feeding <i>T. rendalli</i> ponds was documented by Chikafumbwa et al. (1991).  Chikafumbwa (1996) found that an input rate of 50 kg dry matter.ha-1.day-1 resulted in optimal performance. Typical specific growth rates at this input rate are between 0.45 and 0.50 % per day. Survival in ponds is normally around 70% as <i>T. rendalli</i> is less hardy and more easily captured by predators than other tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
Fry production by <i>T. rendalli</i> is considerably less than for the commonly cultured <i>Oreochromis</i> species. Costa-Pierce (1996) reported that, although these fish are substrate spawners, there was no difference between  fry production in tanks with or without sand substrates. Fry production from the 1 male : 2 females (average  weight 40 g) in that study was between 750 and 900 fry per female over 416 days. Brummett (1997) obtained between 3,000 and 5,000 fry of at least 2 g individual weight over a 9 month period in ponds which were seined with a reed fence either every 60 or 30 days, respectively. Brummett and Noble (1995) reported maximum fry production from 200 m2 ponds stocked with 100 male : 100 female broodstock (average weight 50 g) of over 400 fry per female per two week harvesting interval.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>: In Southern Africa, normally sold whole and fresh on smallholder pond banks.  Splitting and smoking is the preferred method for preservation. Marketed in subSaharan Africa at any size over 50 g.
 <p>
<b>Likely Future Trends</b>: Will remain an important species for farming by smallholders, but could become a more widely farmed commercial species in systems based on  feeding with plant proteins rather than fishmeal. Trials at a commercial farm near Banket, Zimbabwe showed that all-male <i>T. rendalli</i> populations in cages fed with pelleted feeds grew as well as <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under similar conditions.

 <p>
The literature on this species has references to three subspecies:  <i>T. ren. rendalli</i>, <i>T. ren. swierstrae</i>, and <i>T. ren. gefuensis</i> (see Thys van den Audenaerde 1968).  These subspecific names are not universally agreed and are not commonly found in the literature on aquaculture of this species.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is one of  a group of several substrate-spawning tilapias that were formerly called ‘<i>Tilapia melanopleura</i>’ by some authors. <i> T. melanopleura</i> is no longer a valid name.  Trewavas (1982) has described the problems caused by previous inaccurate nomenclature of this and related species and listed the characteristics that distinguish <i>T. rendalli</i> from other species which it was sometimes confused.
 <p>
<b>Common Names</b>: Red Breasted Tilapia, Mudile (Tonga), Rooiborskurper (Afrikaans), Chilunguni (Chichewa).
 <p>
<b>History of Use</b>: A popular foodfish throughout subSaharan Africa. Probably first cultured experimentally in Zaïre in the late 1930’s and established in smallholder ponds in that country by 1947. Although now largely abandoned in Zaïre in favor of other species, still widely cultured by African smallholders for subsistence in low-input systems.
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b>: 843 tons reported to FAO in 1995 from Malawi, Zambia, Colombia, and Dominican Republic. Other countries that farm this tilapia combine population statistics with those for tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
<b>Where Farmed</b>: West, Central and, particularly, Southern Africa. According to Coche et al (1994), <i>T. rendalli</i> is the fourth most widely cultured species reported in a recent sample of  subSaharan African countries. Countries reporting farmed <i>T. rendalli</i> production are: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
 <p>
<b>Climate and Environmental Tolerance</b>: tropics, can withstand temperatures of 10-40° C. Spawns at temperatures above 20 and of up to at least 30° C.

Migrate toward temperate or cold waters in the summer and back to warm waters in the fall.  Adults are opportunistic feeders, known to forage for their food from the surface to the bottom over a wide depth range (Ref. 9702).  Feed mainly on fishes (Atlantic mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, redfish, herring and lanternfishes (Ref. 5951)) but also on crustaceans and squids (Ref. 9354).  They use their sword to kill their prey (Ref. 9354).  Large individuals may accumulate large percentages of mercury in its flesh (Ref. 9354).  Are batch spawners (Ref. 51846).  Spawning takes place in Atlantic during spring in southern Sargasso Sea.  Migrate to cooler waters to feed (Ref. 4689).  Females grow fastest.  Determination of age is difficult since the otoliths are very small and scales are missing in adults.  Year rings have been successfully counted on cross sections of the fin rays (Ref. 35388).  Pelagic eggs measure 1.6-1.8mm and the newly hatched larvae is 4 mm long.  Sword is well developed at a length of 10mm and young live pelagically in the upper water layers where they quickly develop into very voracious predators (Ref. 35388).  Mt DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Ref. 12784).  Good food fish, marketed fresh or frozen, and can be made into sashimi, teriyaki or fillets (Ref. 9354).",NA,1.5,0,5,1990-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,949,2008-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,2,1999-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,NA,226
