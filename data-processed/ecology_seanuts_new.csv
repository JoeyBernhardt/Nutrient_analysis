In some areas such as Shark Bay and the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, adults live in marine waters throughout the year.  This behaviour seems to occur only where estuarine and freshwater habitats are limited (Ref. 28722).  A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).  Migrating sea mullet do not feed during either the 'hardgut' migration or spawning migration (Ref. 6390).  Feed on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, microalgae, and detritus (Ref. 11889).  Undergo ontogenic shift in diet (Ref. 41769).  Small mullet (< 4 cm SL) feed exclusively on sediment by browsing.  Large mullet (< 4 cm SL) have been observed to feed by grazing on the sediment (Ref. 41769).  Changes in the feeding habits from planktonic organisms and migratory zooplankton to meiobenthos which takes place between 0.1 and 0.2 cm length, and a switch from meiobenthos to microbenthos between 0.15 and 0.25 cm length (Ref. 56101).  Sea mullet normally feed close to the river bed in shallow water, but do move throughout the water column in river channels and individuals often jump high out of the water (Ref. 6390).  Sea mullet have a strong tendency to school as juveniles and during the spawning season as adults.  Feeding schools of juveniles commonly disperse over sand and mud flats of estuaries during high tide and reform on the ebb tide (Ref. 28722).  Presence of sharp pointed teeth  that enable the species to select fine material (Ref. 74863).
In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).  Has a short, well-defined juvenile recruitment period; although found in freshwater, occurs in far greater numbers in all areas of estuaries and is common in the sea (Ref. 74748, 74749).  Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

School near the surface with birds, drifting objects, whales, sharks, and other tuna species and shows characteristic behaviors like jumping, feeding and foaming. Opportunistic feeders preying on any forage available. The feeding activity peaks in the early morning and in the late afternoon.
Skipjack tuna also need a dissolved oxygen level of 2.5 ml per liter of sea water to maintain a minimum swimming speed, and require higher levels when active (Ref. 28952). This requirement generally restricts skipjack tuna to water above the thermocline and in some areas, such as the eastern Pacific, may exclude them from surface waters (Ref. 28952).
The warm East Australian Current distributes skipjack tuna larvae into subtropical waters off eastern Australia (Ref. 28956). The larvae are generally limited to the upper 50 m of water and are most common in the sub-surface layers (Ref. 6390). Juvenile skipjack tuna less than 15 cm TL inhabit the same areas as larvae but generally move to cooler waters as they grow to maturity (Ref. 28956).

Feed during the day and at night (diurnal and nocturnal). In Hawaii, adults more common in late spring through early fall; juveniles common in fall and winter (Ref. 4887).
Yellowfin tuna smaller than 15 kg often form surface schools of similar sized fish (Ref. 6390). Schools may be mono-specific (ie, consist of only 1 species) or include other tunas, such as skipjack tuna <i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) (Ref. 6390). Dolphins often associate with surface feeding schools in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but a similar association is not found in the western Pacific (Ref. 6390).
Off southeastern Australia, adult yellowfin tuna tend to be more solitary (Ref. 6390). Fish larger than 15 kg inhabit the deeper waters above the thermocline and tend not to school in Australian waters (Ref. 6390).
A behavioural study in Hawaiian waters using ultrasonic tags (Ref. 30307) showed that during the day yellowin tuna inhabited waters just above the thermocline (50-90 m), with occasional short descents to depths as great as 250 m (Ref. 6390). At night, the tuna tended to stay within 50 m of the surface (Ref. 6390).
Large concentrations of larvae and eggs are reported from the western Pacific, including the Coral Sea, and from the Indian Ocean adjacebt to Australia's North West Shelf (Ref. 30274).
Tagged yellowfin tuna have been reported to move 1000 km or more over a 12-month period, but no directed migration has been demonstrated (Ref. 6390). Recoveries from a tagging study of yellowfin tuna on the Australian east coast between 27°S and 38°S suggested that most yellowfin tuna form local groups that moved no more than a few hundred miles over several years (Ref. 6390). This northward and southward movement of yellowfin tuna along the south-eastern Australian coast is probably associated with the seasonal movement of the warm East Australian Current (Ref. 30310).
