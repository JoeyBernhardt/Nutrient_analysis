Though they occur naturally in open river systems they are never known to dominate the environment.  Larger fish generally  frequent deeper waters.  Common carp are acclimated to a variety of habitats and extremes of environment, eg high salinities and low oxygen concentrations (Ref. 6390).  They have been observed to gulp air at the surface of oxygen-depleted waters (Ref. 30478).  During winter carp go into deeper water which will be comparatively warmer than water in shallow areas.
They are now established in the wild in Zimbabwe (Ref. 4967).
Common carps are active swimmers that can leap obstacles up to 1 meter high and negotiate torrential flows (Ref. 2906).

With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).  The sockeye is one of the most commercially important Pacific salmons; the kokanee is primarily a sport fish but also makes excellent food and in some areas well regarded as food for large trout (Ref. 27547).  Marketed fresh, dried or salted, smoked, canned, and frozen; eaten steamed, fried, broiled, microwaved, and baked (Ref. 9988).  The Alaska Salmon fishery of this species has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (<a>http://www.msc.org/</a>) as well-managed and sustainable (<a>http://www.msc.org/html/content_485.htm</a>).",NA,0.5,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,949,2008-09-10T00:00:00Z,97,2003-01-09T00:00:00Z,NA,243

Omnivorous (Ref. 21, 12524), feed mainly on algae and phytoplankton (Ref. 4537, 7248, 12501, 12522, 12524, 13337, 36683, 44894, 52307) but also take some zooplankton, small insects and their larvae (Ref. 4537, 7248, 12524, 13337, 44894, 52307), shrimps (Ref. 12524, 13337), earthworms (Ref. 12501) and aquatic macrophytes (Ref. 6465).  Juveniles carnivorous/omnivorous, adults tend to be herbivorous or detritus feeders (Ref. 2, 6465, 13517).  Large individuals have been reported to prey on small fishes (Ref. 2, 6465, 12501, 12522), and occasionally cannibalise their own young (Ref. 2, 6465).  Exhibit considerable plasticity in their feeding habits (Ref. 6465, 13544) as well as in their reproductive biology (Ref. 13544).  Polygamous (Ref. 12524, 13337), maternal mouthbrooder (Ref. 1, 5214, 12524, 13337).  Reach sexual maturity at 15 centimeter length (Ref. 44894), but stunted fish may breed at 6-7 centimeters and at an age of just over 2 months (Ref. 52307).  Fecundity high (Ref. 55352).  Extended temperature range 8-42 Â°C, natural temperature range 17-35Â°C (Ref. 3), with salinity-dependent difference in temperature tolerance (Ref. 2, 23).  Somewhat aggressive toward other species (Ref. 36683).  Marketed fresh and frozen (Ref. 9987).  Excellent palatability (Ref. 6465), with small head and large dress-out weight (Ref. 61), and filets without small bones (Ref. 57960).  Used extensively in biological, physiological and behavioural research (Ref. 7248).  Translocated and introduced for aquaculture, sport fishing, stocking man-made lakes and biological control of nuisance plants and animals (Ref. 6465).  Eurytopic; a most successful and vagile invader (Ref. 6465).",NA,0.5,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,2,2012-06-04T00:00:00Z,675,2011-05-28T00:00:00Z,NA,3

In southeastern Australian waters, sharp temperature and salinity gradients across oceanic fronts provide favourable conditions for concentrations of broadbill swordfish (Ref. 6390).  Little is known of large scale movements by adult broadbill swordfish. Mature fish make only limited local movements (Ref. 9742). Tracking of fish using acoustic tags has shown that broadbill swordfish typically move to surface waters at night and inhabit deeper waters during the day, reaching depths up to 600 m (Ref. 30447). These vertical movements may be rapid and involve changes in waters temperature as great as 19Â°C (Ref. 6390). Some tagged fish spend daylight hours near the sea bed close to the continental shelf break or submerged banks and move offshore at night (Ref. 6390). In the eastern Pacific broadbill swordfish are commonly seen basking at the sea surface for short periods during the day, a behaviour that may allow the fish to recover from stress associated with low temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in deep water (Ref. 30447). Broadbill swordfish are normally solitary, but pairs of fish are regularly observed at the surface off the Californian coast (Ref. 30447).
Larvae are most common within a few m of the surface during the day but may move to depths of 30 m at night (Ref. 30448). Swordfish larvae longer than 10 mm feed almost exclusively on larvae of other fish species (Ref. 6390).  Young swordfish is preyed upon by blue shark, tuna and marlins.  Parasites of the species include a cestode, <i>Fistulicola plicatus</i>; trematode, <i>Tristoma</i> spp.; monogenean, <i>Tristoma coccineum</i>and <i>T. integrum</i>; nematode, <i>Thynnascaris incurva</i> and a copepod, <i>Pennella filosa</i> (Ref. 5951).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1991-06-10T00:00:00Z,309,2008-07-01T00:00:00Z,711,2001-11-21T00:00:00Z,226,Xiphias,gladius,43,"Linnaeus, 1758",Swordfish,Xigla_u5.jpg,NA,NA,NA,417,NA,2618,NA,elongated,R,NA,NA,0,0,0,-1,pelagic-oceanic,oceanodromous,51243,0,800,9354,0,550,54934,NA,NA,NA,NA,71.96,455.0,FL,NA,NA,40637,300.0,TL,NA,NA,9354,65e4,NA,4689,XIGLA_U1,NA,NA,NA,4931,commercial,very high,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,NA,"from 50,000 to 100,000",Mostly by Japan (61) and Spain (27),hooks and lines,unspecified longlines (LL),0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,never/rarely,NA,NA,never/rarely,NA,never/rarely,NA,NA,-1,4699,NA,NA,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"Oceanic but sometimes found in coastal waters (Ref. 9354).

Migrate toward temperate or cold waters in the summer and back to warm waters in the fall.  Adults are opportunistic feeders, known to forage for their food from the surface to the bottom over a wide depth range (Ref. 9702).  Feed mainly on fishes (Atlantic mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, redfish, herring and lanternfishes (Ref. 5951)) but also on crustaceans and squids (Ref. 9354).  They use their sword to kill their prey (Ref. 9354).  Large individuals may accumulate large percentages of mercury in its flesh (Ref. 9354).  Are batch spawners (Ref. 51846).  Spawning takes place in Atlantic during spring in southern Sargasso Sea.  Migrate to cooler waters to feed (Ref. 4689).  Females grow fastest.  Determination of age is difficult since the otoliths are very small and scales are missing in adults.  Year rings have been successfully counted on cross sections of the fin rays (Ref. 35388).  Pelagic eggs measure 1.6-1.8mm and the newly hatched larvae is 4 mm long.  Sword is well developed at a length of 10mm and young live pelagically in the upper water layers where they quickly develop into very voracious predators (Ref. 35388).  Mt DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Ref. 12784).

In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).

In fast-flowing rivers, confined to stretches where backwaters or shelters allow for overwintering.  Larvae and juveniles live in wide variety of littoral habitats. Preys predominantly on benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, plant material and detritus.  May shift from littoral to pelagic habitats and between benthic food and zooplankton when abundance of a specific food item is high or for avoidance of predation and/or competition.  Breeds among dense submerged vegetation in backwaters or lakes, flooded meadows or in shallow, fast-flowing river habitats on plant or gravel bottom.  Undertakes short spawning migrations.  Stays in backwaters or in deep parts of lakes to overwinter.  Produces fertile hybrids with <i>Abramis brama</i> (Ref. 59043).  Pale yellow eggs are found attached to vegetation and tree roots (Ref. 41678).  There is only little commercial fishing for this species, but valued for recreational fishing.

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - catla; Hindi-bhakur, catla; Bengali-katal; Punjabi-theila;    Burmese - nga-thaing
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>:  Catla is distributed the rivers of the Indo-Gangetic system in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal.  It is a very popular food fish.  It was introduced between 1904 and 1921 from the river Godavari to the canals, rivers and reservoirs of southern India and during 1930's and 40's to Maharashtra (Powai Lake, Mumbai) and to Kerala (Periyar Lake).  It has also been introduced to other countries, including Japan, the Philippines and the former USSR (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :  There are no reliable statistics on production of catla from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maurituis, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> : Tropics; hardy;  natural temperature range 18-300C; lower and upper thermal tolerance limits, 16.7Â°C and 39.5Â°C; sensitive to low oxygen conditions; tolerates pH 6.5-8.5 and  salinity up to 5 ppt; prefers deep pools; breeds during the southwest monsoon (May - September) in water temperatures around 24 - 31Â°C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Catla breeds naturally in flooded fields and can also be bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.  Catla is now mostly spawned artificially in hatcheries. It is more difficult to spawn than most other carps, and requires good broodstock management.  This is sometimes lacking on farms. The postlarvae called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn' in English.   Catla attain first maturity when about two years old and 442 mm length (Natarajan and Jhingran, 1963).  In nature, they spawn only once during the breeding season but have been spawned up to four times in hatcheries (Gupta et al. 1995).  Fecundity depends on the age, length and weight of the fish and the weight of the ovaries and varies from 0.2 to 4.2 million n fishes weighing between 11.3 to 18.4 Kg fish.  The number of eggs/kg body weight of fish from well-managed broodstock is about 100,000.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to females. A female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.  The yolk-sac is absorbed after three days.
 <p>
The postlarvae are easy to handle and cheap to transport, packed in plastic bags with oxygen.  The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, postlarvae have a survival of 60 - 70%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to fingerlings for stocking in growout ponds or other waters.
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are limed and fertilized before stocking with carp fingerlings at 5,000-10,000/ha. The proportion of catla in the stocked population is 10-35% depending upon the species mix used for polyculture. In polyculture of Indian major carps alone, the proportion of catla can be 30-35%, but in polyculture with exotic carps, the proportion of catla is reduced to 10%, with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) constituting 20% of the total population. The ponds are fertilized every two weeks with cow manure, or a combination of inorganic fertilizers.  <p>Supplementary feed, comprising a 50:50 mixture of oil cake : cereal  bran is provided daily at 2-3% body weight based on the growth registered every month. Its contribution to total production ranges from 10-30%.  Monoculture of catla is not practiced.
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b>:  Some reservoirs in India produce large-sized catla (35-40 kg in weight) which have a special market during the marriage season. Catla has a large sized head, but is otherwise  highly suitable for filleting.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  Catla is a very important species for aquaculture. Seed production currently falls far short of demand. If the availability of catla seed increases and if growth rates can be further improved through genetic enhancement, the contribution of catla to aquaculture production in the Indian subcontinent will increase, with a decline in the importance of silver carp in carp polyculture systems.  Catla also has good potential for processing into fillets and other valued-added products for export.
 <p>
Intergeneric hybrids of catla with Indian and other carp species have been produced (Tripathi 1992) of which the rohu female x catla male hybrid combines the advantages of the deep body of the catla and the small head rohu.  This hybrid is fertile. Naturally occurring catla x rohu hybrids have been found in the Rihand reservoir.

Juveniles move from the tropics into temperate waters and then eastwards along the subtropical convergence zone. At maturity, albacore return to the tropics but go back to temperate waters after spawning (Ref. 6390).
In Australian waters, larvae are present on the North West shelf all summer, but are present off north-eastern Australia mainly between October and December (Ref. 30274). Juveniles are found off New South Wales from September to November, and during summer they follow the warmer waters of the East Australian Current southwards (Ref. 6390). Albacore may reach eastern Tasmanian waters by December, where they remain until about April (Ref. 6390). As autumn approaches and warm waters recede, the juveniles move northwards and are present again off New South Wales until May (Ref. 30278). Adult albacore travel in independent, small groups (Ref. 30273), and are common throughout much of the species' range (Ref. 6390).

In some areas such as Shark Bay and the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, adults live in marine waters throughout the year.  This behaviour seems to occur only where estuarine and freshwater habitats are limited (Ref. 28722).  A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).  Migrating sea mullet do not feed during either the 'hardgut' migration or spawning migration (Ref. 6390).  Feed on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, microalgae, and detritus (Ref. 11889).  Undergo ontogenic shift in diet (Ref. 41769).  Small mullet (< 4 cm SL) feed exclusively on sediment by browsing.  Large mullet (< 4 cm SL) have been observed to feed by grazing on the sediment (Ref. 41769).  Changes in the feeding habits from planktonic organisms and migratory zooplankton to meiobenthos which takes place between 0.1 and 0.2 cm length, and a switch from meiobenthos to microbenthos between 0.15 and 0.25 cm length (Ref. 56101).  Sea mullet normally feed close to the river bed in shallow water, but do move throughout the water column in river channels and individuals often jump high out of the water (Ref. 6390).  Sea mullet have a strong tendency to school as juveniles and during the spawning season as adults.  Feeding schools of juveniles commonly disperse over sand and mud flats of estuaries during high tide and reform on the ebb tide (Ref. 28722).  Presence of sharp pointed teeth  that enable the species to select fine material (Ref. 74863).
In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).  Has a short, well-defined juvenile recruitment period; although found in freshwater, occurs in far greater numbers in all areas of estuaries and is common in the sea (Ref. 74748, 74749).  Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

It has been suggested that the species should be now assigned to <i>Gadus</i>, although none of these works had a conclusive statement with a complete taxonomic re-assessment. However, the name <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> may be used in scientific publications.  If the American Fisheries Society has endorsed that change in the latest edition of its list of fish names, FAO will not change it until a more stable consensus is reached.  Since this species is highly commercial, with a number of regulations and statistical reports using that name, it is preferable to change it with the strongest scientific support.  In addition, they are other taxonomic issue in that family, with the same issues about names.

It has been suggested that the species should be now assigned to <i>Gadus</i>, although none of these works had a conclusive statement with a complete taxonomic re-assessment. However, the name <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> may be used in scientific publications.  If the American Fisheries Society has endorsed that change in the latest edition of its list of fish names, FAO will not change it until a more stable consensus is reached.  Since this species is highly commercial, with a number of regulations and statistical reports using that name, it is preferable to change it with the strongest scientific support.  In addition, they are other taxonomic issue in that family, with the same issues about names.

They are traded as fresh fish, boneless flesh, in frozen blocks or as Surimi.  The fish is cooked in the microwave, steamed or fried in butter (Ref. 9988).

 <p>
<b>Common names</b>: English, Hindi and Punjabi - rohu;  Bengali-rui; Burmese- nga-myit-chin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0Â°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9Â°C; reproduces between 22-31.0Â°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.
 <p>
Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

One to two years old juveniles move from backwaters to river to feed. In the absence of opportunity to leave backwaters, juveniles may adapt but have a slower growth and attain maturity at a smaller size.  They also drift to brackishwater estuaries to forage when water level of flooded areas drops in lower reaches of large rivers. Foraging juveniles in brackish waters stay in lower parts of rivers to overwinter in freshwater (Ref. 59043).  Feed on insects, particularly chironomids, small crustaceans, mollusks and plants.  Larger specimens may feed on small fish.  Juveniles feed on zooplankton (Ref. 30578).  Able to shift to particle feeding or even filter feeding at high zooplankton abundance.  Usually spawn in backwaters, floodplains or lakes shores with dense vegetation (Ref. 59043).  Can survive out of the water for extended periods (Ref. 9988).

Isotope analysis has shown that shortfin mako is the highest level fish predator in oceanic waters off eastern Australia (Ref. 86961).  Adults feed on bony fishes, other sharks (Ref. 5578), cephalopods; larger individuals may feed on larger prey such as billfish and small cetaceans (Ref. 6871, 58048). Ovoviviparous, embryos feeding on yolk sac and other ova produced by the mother (Ref. 43278, 50449).  With 4-16 young of about 60-70 cm long (Ref. 35388, 26346).  Gestation period lasts 15-18 months, spawning cycle is every 3 years.  Some authors (Refs. 1661, 28081, 31395) have erroneously assumed that two age rings are deposited per year by this species, thus underestimating longevity, age at maturity, and resilience . These data have been removed and replaced by recent, verified estimates (Refs. 86586, 86587, 86588).  Tagging in New Zealand indicates seasonal migrations (Ref. 26346).  The presence of genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA across global populations (Ref. 36416) suggests dispersal may be male-biased, and that females may have natal site-fidelity.  Shortfin mako has been shown to have a marked sexually segregated population structure (Ref. 86954).  
Shortfin mako is probably the fastest of all sharks and can leap out of the water when hooked (Ref. 6871).  Potentially dangerous and responsible for unprovoked attacks on swimmers and boats (Ref. 13574).  Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; eaten broiled and baked (Ref. 9988).  Valued for its fine quality meat as well as its fins and skin (Ref. 247).  Oil is extracted for vitamins and fins for shark-fin soup (Ref. 13574).

In such cases, juveniles feed on invertebrates and terrestrial vertebrates; large individuals are mainly cannibals (Ref. 59043). Cannibalistic as juveniles (Ref. 30578).  Feces of pike are avoided by other fish because they contain alarm pheromones.  Deposits feces at specific locations, distant from its foraging area (Ref. 59043).  Eggs and young are preyed upon by fishes, aquatic insect larvae, birds, and aquatic mammals (Ref. 1998).  Does not generally undertake long migrations, but a few may move considerable distances (Ref. 27547).  Oviparous (Ref. 205). This fish can be heavily infested with parasites, including the broad tapeworm which, if not killed by thorough cooking, can infect human; is used as an intermediate host by a cestode parasite which results to large losses in usable catches of lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>) in some areas; also suffers from a trematode which causes unsightly cysts on the skin (Ref. 9988).  Excellent food fish; utilized fresh and frozen; eaten pan-fried, broiled, and baked (Ref. 9988).  Valuable game fish (Ref. 5723).  In spite of numerous attempts to culture this species, it was never entirely domesticated and does not accept artificial food (Ref. 30578).  Locally impacted by habitat alterations (Ref. 59043).",NA,0.5157,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,10,2012-06-25T00:00:00Z,97,2003-01-14T00:00:00Z,NA,258

They occur from estuaries of large lowland rivers as well as from small mountain streams, preferring deep waters in summer (Ref. 59043).  They seek shelter under rocks, in crevices on the river banks, among roots of trees and dense vegetation (Ref. 30578, 10294).

Smaller individuals feed on insect larvae, crayfish, mollusks and other invertebrates with a changing preference for fishes in larger individuals (Ref. 1998, 10294).  In Central Europe, males mature at 2 years while females at 3 years (Ref. 59043).  Spawning occurs from November to March, at temperatures below 6Â°C in groups of up to 20 interlaced individuals forming a ball about 60 cm in diameter which constantly moves and rolls on the bottom while releasing eggs and sperms (Ref. 59043). May undertake short spawning migrations (Ref. 59043).  Eggs are semipelagic, 1.2-1.8 mm in diameter and slightly sticky hatching after 40-70 days (Ref. 59043).

It has been suggested that the species should be now assigned to <i>Gadus</i>, although none of these works had a conclusive statement with a complete taxonomic re-assessment. However, the name <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> may be used in scientific publications.  If the American Fisheries Society has endorsed that change in the latest edition of its list of fish names, FAO will not change it until a more stable consensus is reached.  Since this species is highly commercial, with a number of regulations and statistical reports using that name, it is preferable to change it with the strongest scientific support.  In addition, they are other taxonomic issue in that family, with the same issues about names.

Upon reaching the sea, the smolts remain close to the coast for a certain time, eating planktonic crustaceans (Ref. 27547). As they grow, they migrate farther out into the sea and hunt larger organisms (Ref. 27547) such as jellyfish, squids and fishes (Ref. 58426).  They are hunted by various fishes, birds (mergansers, loons and kingfishers), mammals and lampreys (Ref. 1998).  This kind is traded as fresh fish, dried or salted, smoked, canned, preserved and frozen (Ref. 9988).  They are steamed, grilled, broiled, cooked in the microwave and baked (Ref. 9988).

In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).

There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).  The sockeye is one of the most commercially important Pacific salmons; the kokanee is primarily a sport fish but also makes excellent food and in some areas well regarded as food for large trout (Ref. 27547).  Marketed fresh, dried or salted, smoked, canned, and frozen; eaten steamed, fried, broiled, microwaved, and baked (Ref. 9988).

Some fish, popularly known as salters, run to the sea in the spring as stream temperatures rises, but never venture more than a few kilometers from river mouths. It may remain at sea for up to three months (Ref. 28546, 28549, 28551).  Feeds on a wide range of organisms including worms, leeches, crustaceans, insects (chironomids, caddisflies, blackflies, mayflies, stoneflies and dragonflies (Ref. 5951), mollusks, fishes and amphibians (Ref. 3348, 10294); also small mammals (Ref. 1998).

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - mrigal; Bengali-mirka, mrigal;  Punjabi-nain; Burmese - nga-gyin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b> :  The mrigal (<i>Cirrhinus cirrhosus</i>) is the most widely farmed species among the Indian major carps of the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  It also found in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal. It is an important component of carp polyculture throughout South Asia. It was introduced for aquaculture, together with catla (<i>Catla catla</i>) and rohu  (<i>Labeo rohita</i>), to other areas of India beyond its natural range in the early 1940's and in the 1950's and 1960's to other Asian countries (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :   There are no reliable statistics on production of mrigal from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :   Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia,  Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>  :  Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> :  Tropics, hardy, can tolerate low oxygen conditions and  salinity levels of 5 ppt; minimum tolerable temperature, 140C; reproduces between 27 - 310C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, mrigal seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.).  Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).  Mrigal is one of the easiest of the major carps to breed in captivity. <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn'. Postlarvae are usually stocked directly into nursery ponds, raised to advanced fry or fingerlings and then transferred to larger waterbodies. In Bangladesh, mixed postlarvae of mrigal, catla and rohu are stocked in large open waterbodies (haors and beels), from which the fish disperse over vast expanses of water during the annual floods.
 <p>
Mrigal attain first maturity when about two years old  (800 - 1,200 g) and spawn during the south-west monsoon.  The main spawning period is June to August.   In hatcheries, the same fish can spawn two to three times, early in the season.  They lose condition towards the end of the season. The fecundity of mrigal ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 eggs/kg body weight (Jhingran and Khan 1979).
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. a female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.
 <p>
Nursery ponds are prepared by liming and fertilization with cover or poultry manure, to produce zooplankton (especially rotifers and small claducerans).  Before stocking the nursery ponds the predators of postlarvae, especially copepods and insects, are controlled with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  Postlarvae are stocked at 5 million/ha and are given supplementary feed in the form of a fine powder comprising a 1:1 mixture of groundnut/mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran.  This is given daily at two,  three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the ration at five days intervals. The postlarvae grow to about 25 mm in 15 days, with survival around 70%.
 <p>
The fry are raised in larger rearing ponds which are fertilized in a similar manner to nursery ponds and then normally stocked as part of a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The total stocking rate in rearing ponds is usually around 100,00 - 125,000 fry/ha, of which 30-40% are mrigal.  Mrigal is a bottom feeder and consumes mainly detritus and decayed vegetation, along with some plankton (20-25%).
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are stocked with mrigal fingerlings at 10-35% of the total stocking density density depending upon the species mix. In polyculture of Indian major carps (catla, rohu and mrigal), mrigal are normally 30-40%  of the population but this is reduced to 10-15% when common carp are included. Growout ponds are also prepared initially by liming and fertilization with periodic fertilization (organic and inorganic) thereafter. Mrigal normally registers better growth than rohu in ponds that have rich bottom feeding or when supplementary feed is provided regularly. In  sewage-fed ponds, mrigal attain a weight of about 1 kg in 6 months.
 <p>
Several intergeneric hybrids of Indian major carps have been produced in attempts to obtain  faster-growing fish for aquaculture. The best cross so far is that between female mrigal and male rohu, called mrighu. It has a smaller head than rohu and a body deeper than both  parents. It is also fertile.  Such hybrids are also commonly available in the seed from dry bundhs (Tripathi 1992).
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b> :   Mrigal is a tasty fish, despite its fine bones.  It has a good market wherever it is farmed or fished. It is marketed either fresh or packed with ice.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b> :   Mrigal will continue to be a very important species in carp polyculture in Asia. Monoculture of mrigal is not known at present, but the  availability of improved genetic material (such as that being developed in Vietnam) may lead to the development of cage, pen, running water, and closed recirculatory systems, using mrigal alone.  Mrigal is also a good fish for sewage-fed  ponds, where the abundance of  natural food almost high density stocking.

Adults occur usually in still and slow-running waters where they travel in large shoals (Ref. 9696).  Larvae and juveniles live in still water bodies, feeding on plankton. One to two years old juveniles move from backwaters to river to feed. In the absence of opportunity to leave backwaters, juveniles may adapt but have a slower growth and attain maturity at a smaller size.  They also drift to brackishwater estuaries to forage when water level of flooded areas drops in lower reaches of large rivers. Foraging juveniles in brackish waters stay in lower parts of rivers to overwinter in freshwater (Ref. 59043).  Feed on insects, particularly chironomids, small crustaceans, mollusks and plants.  Larger specimens may feed on small fish.  Juveniles feed on zooplankton (Ref. 30578).  Able to shift to particle feeding or even filter feeding at high zooplankton abundance.  Usually spawn in backwaters, floodplains or lakes shores with dense vegetation (Ref. 59043).  Can survive out of the water for extended periods (Ref. 9988).

Occurs in medium to large rivers, brooks, flooded fields and stagnant water bodies including sluggish flowing canals (Ref. 12975).  Recorde from rice fields (Ref. 50862). Often found in areas with dense vegetation (Ref. 12693).  Can tolerate extremely unfavorable water conditions and is associated mainly with turbid, stagnant waters (Ref. 6028).  Remains buried under the mud during dry season (Ref. 1479).  Feeds on macrophytic vegetation, shrimps and fish fry (Ref. 6028).

Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30Â°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25Â°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712).

Juveniles are found over soft substrates in shallow and sheltered coastal waters. They are often found over seagrass (e.g. <i>Posidonia</i> species) beds in mangrove-lined (<i>Avicennia</i> species) creeks (Ref. 27967). They can tolerate temperature and salinity extremes, such as those found in gulfs in South Australia and the Coorong. Larger fish move into exposed, coastal waters, such as around rocky headlands, near reefs and the surf zone (Ref. 6390). Juveniles of 4-6 cm FL appear in shallow, sheltered Tasmanian waters between January and September (Ref. 6390).
Juveniles feed on zooplankton and epibenthic species of fish, squid, crustaceans and polychaete worms (Ref. 27967). They exhibit diel and seasonal diet shift which may be related to changes in the availability of prey (Ref. 27967). In New Zealand, adults appear to change their diet from planktonic crustaceans when they are less than 10 cm in length to fishes when larger (Ref. 27967), according to a study conducted by Baker (1971). Competitive interactions between its closest relative,<i>Arripis truttaceus</i>, may also be a factor in the seasonal dietary shifts. This needs further investigation (Ref. 27967).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,NA,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,1998-11-23T00:00:00Z,2,2000-12-03T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,5048,Arripis,trutta,9701,"(Forster, 1801)",Australian salmon,Artru_u0.jpg,NA,NA,NA,321,NA,767,NA,fusiform / normal,r,NA,NA,0,0,-1,-1,pelagic-neritic,anadromous,51243,30,39,58489,NA,NA,NA,26.0,9072,NA,NA,40.79,89.0,TL,NA,NA,27296,47.0,TL,NA,NA,9258,9400.0,NA,9988,ARTRU_U0,NA,NA,NA,4931,commercial,very high,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,"For human consumption, pet food, & lobster bait.","from 1,000 to 10,000",Areas 57 and 81,seines,purse seines (PS),0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,never/rarely,NA,NA,usually,4537,never/rarely,NA,NA,-1,4699,harmless,NA,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"Inhabit continental shelf waters including estuaries, bays and inlets (Ref. 6390).

Feeds on insects, crustaceans, molluscs and fish (Ref. 28714).  Juveniles of up to 5 cm feed exclusively on aquatic invertebrates (Ref. 11247).  Fishes more than 18 cm TL long are predominantly piscivorous , but they include larger invertebrates in their diet until they reach ca. 50 cm TL, after which they appear to subsist wholly on fish (Ref. 34291).  In the range of 15-45cm they heavily depend on fish and to a lesser degree on insects (Ref. 33614).  The choice of either piscivorous or invertebrate diet depends on fish size and availibilty of food items (Ref. 11247).  Diet differences have been observed in areas with different bottom hardness (Ref. 52014), but the diet is more varied over a hard bottom (Ref. 52014).

Adults occur in fairly shallow water with fast current, often beside the swirls created by piles of bridges or rocks (Ref. 30578).  They inhabit moderate to fast-flowing large to medium sized rivers with rock or gravel bottom. Larvae occur below surface and feeding larvae inhabit along shores.  Early juveniles live on the bottom in very shallow shoreline habitats. When growing, they move from the shore for faster-flowing waters.  Juveniles overwinter in backwaters or in cavities along shores.  During winter, adults form dense swarms in lower parts of rivers.  Larvae and early juveniles prey on small invertebrates while larger juveniles and adults feed on benthic diatoms and detritus.

Water parameters appear to play only a very minor role (Ref. 78218).  The presence of an accessory breathing organ enables this species to breath air when very active or under very dry conditions.  They remain in the muddy substrates of ponds and occasionally gulp air through the mouth (Ref. 6465).  Can leave the water at night using its strong pectoral fins and spines in search of land-based food or can move into the breeding areas through very shallow pathways (Ref. 6868).  Are omnivorous bottom feeders which occasionally feed at the surface (Ref. 248).  Feed at night on a wide variety of prey (Ref. 6868) like  insects, plankton, invertebrates and fish but also take in young birds, rotting flesh and plants (Ref. 6465).  Migrate to rivers and temporary streams to spawn (Ref. 34291).  Also caught with dragnets.

Migrates considerable distances in an annual cycle between deeper waters in winter and shallower waters in summer (Ref. 26141).  Epibenthic-pelagic (Ref. 58426).  Feeds more intensively in the winter. Preferred food items are ctenophores, medusae, small crustaceans, polychaetes and small fishes (Ref. 4701).  It is preyed upon by seals, sperm whale and Greenland shark.

Spawning, courtship, and parental care behavior study in Newfoundland qualifies this species as brooders where females migrate to inshore spawning areas asynchronously and with male-male interaction rare; the male ignoring its neighbor while tending its eggs (Ref. 39711).

Returns to rivers as water levels begin to fall in October with numbers increasing through December and then slowly declining (Ref. 12693).  From just upstream Phnom Penh in Cambodia to the Khone Falls this species is reported to migrate upstream during the period October-February.  At Muk Kompul in Kandal Province, it migrates upstream just before the full moon.  Further upstream near Kratie, migration occurs during full moon and at Sambor, migration takes place immediately after full moon.  Near the Khone Falls, upstream movements continue through March but in April fish are moving in both direction.  From May to July, at the start of the rainy season, it migrates downstream from the Khone Falls to the Mekong Delta.  Here, the fish is reported to move out of the Mekong into canals and  flooded areas in August-September.  When water recedes in November-December, fish migrates to the Mekong again.  Upstream the Khone Falls near Ubolratchatani in Thailand, this species moves upstream between February and June, consisting mainly of juveniles in February-March and of adults (15-20 cm)  in April-June.  Further upstream from Xayabouri in Laos to Chiang Khong in Thailand, upstream migrations takes place between March to July, first by juveniles, later by adults (Ref. 37770).

Crepuscular and nocturnal (Ref. 11941).  Adults are found in well oxygenated flowing waters and large, deep lakes as well as large rivers with slow-moving current (Ref. 5723, 10294). They occur from estuaries of large lowland rivers as well as from small mountain streams, preferring deep waters in summer (Ref. 59043).  They seek shelter under rocks, in crevices on the river banks, among roots of trees and dense vegetation (Ref. 30578, 10294).  Those in rivers tend to congregate in deep holes throughout the year, except at spawning (Ref. 27547).  Movements into shallower water during summer nights are related to feeding (Ref. 1998).  Smaller individuals feed on insect larvae, crayfish, mollusks and other invertebrates with a changing preference for fishes in larger individuals (Ref. 1998, 10294).  In Central Europe, males mature at 2 years while females at 3 years (Ref. 59043).  Spawning occurs from November to March, at temperatures below 6Â°C in groups of up to 20 interlaced individuals forming a ball about 60 cm in diameter which constantly moves and rolls on the bottom while releasing eggs and sperms (Ref. 59043). May undertake short spawning migrations (Ref. 59043).  Eggs are semipelagic, 1.2-1.8 mm in diameter and slightly sticky hatching after 40-70 days (Ref. 59043).  Larvae are positively phototactic, floating below the surface in March and April (Ref. 59043).  Larvae feed on drifting invertebrates or zooplankton (Ref. 59043).  Source of oil.  Sold mainly salted.  Liver is sold smoked or canned in Europe (Ref. 1998).  Processed into fishmeal (Ref. 1998).  Because of its nocturnal habits and its slow movements, this fish is not very much appreciated by sport fishermen.  Flesh is tasty but a little dry (Ref. 30578).

A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).

In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).

Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

Dying or illness feigning by the juvenile comb grouper (visually estimated to be about 15-20 cm TL) was recorded at SÃ£o SebastiÃ£o Channel, Paulo coast. It was observed lying on its side on the gravel/sandy bottom, occasionally undulating its body but remaining stationary at the same spot stabilized by its paired fins and keeping the dorsal fin retracted, appearing to be ill or injured (dying).  When small  inquisitive fishes approached within 1 m, the comb grouper lunged forward and seized one of the fish (Ref. 55761).

Common in tanks throughout the greater parts of India.  Feed on insects, fish (Ref. 12693), crustaceans and some young roots of aquatic plants (Ref. 6459).  Active during twilight and night.  Colonize and breed seasonally during rainy days and migrates back to permanent waters in dry season (Ref. 12693).  Breeding takes place in stagnant or running waters in the rainy season.  Eggs are laid in small clumps on submerged vegetation.  A female measuring 21-25 cm usually lays 1,200-3,000 eggs.  The fish is relished both in fresh and dried state.  Soup made from it is reported to be given to people with measles (Ref. 7431).  Of high economic importance as food fish in South and Southeast Asia to Borneo and Sumatra and taken by all types of small-scale fishing gears (Ref. 57235).",NA,1.001,0,2,1993-04-30T00:00:00Z,65,2014-02-27T00:00:00Z,10,2001-06-29T00:00:00Z,NA,7990

Eggs grouped in long white ribbons (up to 1 m) are found over submerged objects (Ref. 41678).  Its flesh is excellent and not so bony.  Utilized fresh and frozen; eaten pan-fried and baked (Ref. 9988).

In Western North Atlantic, it undergoes ontogenetic shift in the diet associated with the transition from oceanic to coastal habitats. Pelagic juveniles feed mainly on copepods prior to entry to the estuary, and primarily on fishes after entry to estuary (Ref. 12139). Tailor populations in South Africa and North America display definite seasonal migratory patterns, moving from higher latitudes to sub-tropical waters in winter (Ref. 1120, 6845). Tagging studies in Queensland and New South Wales have confirmed that a similar migratory pattern occurs in eastern Australian waters, at least north of Sydney (Ref. 6390).
Tailor are cannibalistic and can be caught readily by anglers using tailor flesh as bait although the extent of their predation upon other tailor is probably limited by the species' tendency to school by size (Ref. 27687).

Most abundant in nutrient-rich lakes and large to medium sized rivers and backwaters.  Also recorded from small lowland streams and from brackish coastal lagoons.  In fast-flowing rivers, confined to stretches where backwaters or shelters allow for overwintering.  Larvae and juveniles live in wide variety of littoral habitats. Preys predominantly on benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, plant material and detritus.  May shift from littoral to pelagic habitats and between benthic food and zooplankton when abundance of a specific food item is high or for avoidance of predation and/or competition.  Breeds among dense submerged vegetation in backwaters or lakes, flooded meadows or in shallow, fast-flowing river habitats on plant or gravel bottom.  Undertakes short spawning migrations.  Stays in backwaters or in deep parts of lakes to overwinter.  Produces fertile hybrids with <i>Abramis brama</i> (Ref. 59043).

But permanently resident populations also seem to exist. The resident fish simply disperse from the reefs after spawning, while the migrating fish move up to 1000 nautical miles to the south (Ref. 30203). On the Queensland east coast, migration from the Lizard Island-Townsville area takes place ater the spawning season when a significant proportion of 2 and 3-year-old fish moves southwards. A return migration of 3 and 4-year-old fish comences during winter (Ref. 30199). On the west coast, the mackerel follow the 22-24Â°C isotherm (Ref. 30205), generally moving south in the late summer and north during the winter.
The migration route in the Gulf of Thailand has been mapped (Ref. 6783). Feeding apparently occurs day and night.
In north Queensland, small juveniles up to 10 m FL live in creeks, estuaries and along areas of sheltered mud flats in the early wet season (December-January) (Ref. 30194). Juveniles of 15-40 cm FL are caught by prawn trawlers working shallow water during February and March (Ref. 30194). After May, Spanish mackerel of about 40 cm FL are caught in reef waters in the commecial hook-and-line fishery (Ref. 30194).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58534,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1990-10-19T00:00:00Z,1472,2007-09-05T00:00:00Z,711,2001-11-21T00:00:00Z,121,Scomberomorus,commerson,168,"(LacepÃ¨de, 1800)",Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel,Sccom_ue.jpg,NA,NA,NA,416,Scombrinae,2960,NA,fusiform / normal,R,NA,NA,0,0,0,-1,pelagic-neritic,oceanodromous,51243,10,70,12260,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41.18,240.0,FL,NA,NA,5765,120.0,TL,NA,NA,5450,7e4,NA,5765,SCCOM_U2,NA,NA,NA,4931,highly commercial,very high,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,NA,"from 100,000 to 500,000","Indon., Phil., India, Oman",gillnets,drift gillnets (GND),-1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,never/rarely,NA,NA,never/rarely,NA,never/rarely,NA,NA,-1,4699,reports of ciguatera poisoning,168,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"Distributed from near edge of continental shelf to shallow coastal waters, often of low salinity and high turbidity (Ref. 30199, 48637).

Males and gravid females usually found shallower than non-gravid females. Tolerates brackish water, often found in enclosed bays and estuaries. Reported to enter freshwater (Ref. 11980) but cannot survive there for more than a few hours (Ref. 247). Highly migratory species, used to be observed in large foraging schools with up to thousands of individuals, usually segregated by size and /or sex, with schools of large gravid females preferentially targeted by fisheries. Their latitudinal (north-south) and depth-related (nearshore-offshore) movements appear to be correlated with their preferred temperature (Ref. 247). Tagging experiments showed that populations in the northern North Sea and northwest Scotland made winter migrations to off Norway and summer migrations to Scotland (Ref. 88880, 88881).

Large fish may enter the Sea of Japan from the south in early summer and move as far north as the Okhotsk Sea, most leave the Sea of Japan through Tsugara Strait, north of Honshu. Variations in the food spectrum are attributed primarily to behavioral differences in feeding: 'vigorous pursuit' would be required on small schooling fishes (anchovies, sauries, hakes) or on squids, while 'modified filter-feeding' is used to feed on red crabs and other less agile organisms (Ref. 168).

 <p>
The literature on this species has references to three subspecies:  <i>T. ren. rendalli</i>, <i>T. ren. swierstrae</i>, and <i>T. ren. gefuensis</i> (see Thys van den Audenaerde 1968).  These subspecific names are not universally agreed and are not commonly found in the literature on aquaculture of this species.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is one of  a group of several substrate-spawning tilapias that were formerly called â<i>Tilapia melanopleura</i>â by some authors. <i> T. melanopleura</i> is no longer a valid name.  Trewavas (1982) has described the problems caused by previous inaccurate nomenclature of this and related species and listed the characteristics that distinguish <i>T. rendalli</i> from other species which it was sometimes confused.
 <p>
<b>Common Names</b>: Red Breasted Tilapia, Mudile (Tonga), Rooiborskurper (Afrikaans), Chilunguni (Chichewa).
 <p>
<b>History of Use</b>: A popular foodfish throughout subSaharan Africa. Probably first cultured experimentally in ZaÃ¯re in the late 1930âs and established in smallholder ponds in that country by 1947. Although now largely abandoned in ZaÃ¯re in favor of other species, still widely cultured by African smallholders for subsistence in low-input systems.
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b>: 843 tons reported to FAO in 1995 from Malawi, Zambia, Colombia, and Dominican Republic. Other countries that farm this tilapia combine population statistics with those for tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
<b>Where Farmed</b>: West, Central and, particularly, Southern Africa. According to Coche et al (1994), <i>T. rendalli</i> is the fourth most widely cultured species reported in a recent sample of  subSaharan African countries. Countries reporting farmed <i>T. rendalli</i> production are: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
 <p>
<b>Climate and Environmental Tolerance</b>: tropics, can withstand temperatures of 10-40Â° C. Spawns at temperatures above 20 and of up to at least 30Â° C. For juveniles, which often forage in very shallow littoral areas, Caulton (1976) demonstrated a temperature preferendum of 35-37Â° Reported to survive salinities of 13, 18 and 26 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current Farming Methods</b>: Commercially produced in a cage-based system in Mazvikadei Dam, Zimbabwe; otherwise in small ponds generally of no more than 550 m2. Can support commercial fisheries when stocked into managed reservoirs. Pond inputs are green, leafy materials which are readily eaten by <i>T. rendalli</i> of over 20 g.  Smaller individuals are largely omnivorous.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is a voracious feeder and can consume up to 20% of its body weight per day in fresh green materials. A range of plants suitable for feeding <i>T. rendalli</i> ponds was documented by Chikafumbwa et al. (1991).  Chikafumbwa (1996) found that an input rate of 50 kg dry matter.ha-1.day-1 resulted in optimal performance. Typical specific growth rates at this input rate are between 0.45 and 0.50 % per day. Survival in ponds is normally around 70% as <i>T. rendalli</i> is less hardy and more easily captured by predators than other tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
Fry production by <i>T. rendalli</i> is considerably less than for the commonly cultured <i>Oreochromis</i> species. Costa-Pierce (1996) reported that, although these fish are substrate spawners, there was no difference between  fry production in tanks with or without sand substrates. Fry production from the 1 male : 2 females (average  weight 40 g) in that study was between 750 and 900 fry per female over 416 days. Brummett (1997) obtained between 3,000 and 5,000 fry of at least 2 g individual weight over a 9 month period in ponds which were seined with a reed fence either every 60 or 30 days, respectively. Brummett and Noble (1995) reported maximum fry production from 200 m2 ponds stocked with 100 male : 100 female broodstock (average weight 50 g) of over 400 fry per female per two week harvesting interval.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>: In Southern Africa, normally sold whole and fresh on smallholder pond banks.  Splitting and smoking is the preferred method for preservation. Marketed in subSaharan Africa at any size over 50 g.
 <p>
<b>Likely Future Trends</b>: Will remain an important species for farming by smallholders, but could become a more widely farmed commercial species in systems based on  feeding with plant proteins rather than fishmeal. Trials at a commercial farm near Banket, Zimbabwe showed that all-male <i>T. rendalli</i> populations in cages fed with pelleted feeds grew as well as <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under similar conditions.

Survival in ponds is normally around 70% as <i>T. rendalli</i> is less hardy and more easily captured by predators than other tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
Fry production by <i>T. rendalli</i> is considerably less than for the commonly cultured <i>Oreochromis</i> species. Costa-Pierce (1996) reported that, although these fish are substrate spawners, there was no difference between  fry production in tanks with or without sand substrates. Fry production from the 1 male : 2 females (average  weight 40 g) in that study was between 750 and 900 fry per female over 416 days. Brummett (1997) obtained between 3,000 and 5,000 fry of at least 2 g individual weight over a 9 month period in ponds which were seined with a reed fence either every 60 or 30 days, respectively. Brummett and Noble (1995) reported maximum fry production from 200 m2 ponds stocked with 100 male : 100 female broodstock (average weight 50 g) of over 400 fry per female per two week harvesting interval.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>: In Southern Africa, normally sold whole and fresh on smallholder pond banks.  Splitting and smoking is the preferred method for preservation. Marketed in subSaharan Africa at any size over 50 g.
 <p>
<b>Likely Future Trends</b>: Will remain an important species for farming by smallholders, but could become a more widely farmed commercial species in systems based on  feeding with plant proteins rather than fishmeal. Trials at a commercial farm near Banket, Zimbabwe showed that all-male <i>T. rendalli</i> populations in cages fed with pelleted feeds grew as well as <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under similar conditions.

 <p>
The literature on this species has references to three subspecies:  <i>T. ren. rendalli</i>, <i>T. ren. swierstrae</i>, and <i>T. ren. gefuensis</i> (see Thys van den Audenaerde 1968).  These subspecific names are not universally agreed and are not commonly found in the literature on aquaculture of this species.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is one of  a group of several substrate-spawning tilapias that were formerly called â<i>Tilapia melanopleura</i>â by some authors. <i> T. melanopleura</i> is no longer a valid name.  Trewavas (1982) has described the problems caused by previous inaccurate nomenclature of this and related species and listed the characteristics that distinguish <i>T. rendalli</i> from other species which it was sometimes confused.
 <p>
<b>Common Names</b>: Red Breasted Tilapia, Mudile (Tonga), Rooiborskurper (Afrikaans), Chilunguni (Chichewa).
 <p>
<b>History of Use</b>: A popular foodfish throughout subSaharan Africa. Probably first cultured experimentally in ZaÃ¯re in the late 1930âs and established in smallholder ponds in that country by 1947. Although now largely abandoned in ZaÃ¯re in favor of other species, still widely cultured by African smallholders for subsistence in low-input systems.
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b>: 843 tons reported to FAO in 1995 from Malawi, Zambia, Colombia, and Dominican Republic. Other countries that farm this tilapia combine population statistics with those for tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
<b>Where Farmed</b>: West, Central and, particularly, Southern Africa. According to Coche et al (1994), <i>T. rendalli</i> is the fourth most widely cultured species reported in a recent sample of  subSaharan African countries. Countries reporting farmed <i>T. rendalli</i> production are: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
 <p>
<b>Climate and Environmental Tolerance</b>: tropics, can withstand temperatures of 10-40Â° C. Spawns at temperatures above 20 and of up to at least 30Â° C. For juveniles, which often forage in very shallow littoral areas, Caulton (1976) demonstrated a temperature preferendum of 35-37Â° Reported to survive salinities of 13, 18 and 26 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current Farming Methods</b>: Commercially produced in a cage-based system in Mazvikadei Dam, Zimbabwe; otherwise in small ponds generally of no more than 550 m2. Can support commercial fisheries when stocked into managed reservoirs. Pond inputs are green, leafy materials which are readily eaten by <i>T. rendalli</i> of over 20 g.  Smaller individuals are largely omnivorous.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is a voracious feeder and can consume up to 20% of its body weight per day in fresh green materials. A range of plants suitable for feeding <i>T. rendalli</i> ponds was documented by Chikafumbwa et al. (1991).  Chikafumbwa (1996) found that an input rate of 50 kg dry matter.ha-1.day-1 resulted in optimal performance. Typical specific growth rates at this input rate are between 0.45 and 0.50 % per day. Survival in ponds is normally around 70% as <i>T. rendalli</i> is less hardy and more easily captured by predators than other tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
Fry production by <i>T. rendalli</i> is considerably less than for the commonly cultured <i>Oreochromis</i> species. Costa-Pierce (1996) reported that, although these fish are substrate spawners, there was no difference between  fry production in tanks with or without sand substrates. Fry production from the 1 male : 2 females (average  weight 40 g) in that study was between 750 and 900 fry per female over 416 days. Brummett (1997) obtained between 3,000 and 5,000 fry of at least 2 g individual weight over a 9 month period in ponds which were seined with a reed fence either every 60 or 30 days, respectively. Brummett and Noble (1995) reported maximum fry production from 200 m2 ponds stocked with 100 male : 100 female broodstock (average weight 50 g) of over 400 fry per female per two week harvesting interval.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>: In Southern Africa, normally sold whole and fresh on smallholder pond banks.  Splitting and smoking is the preferred method for preservation. Marketed in subSaharan Africa at any size over 50 g.
 <p>
<b>Likely Future Trends</b>: Will remain an important species for farming by smallholders, but could become a more widely farmed commercial species in systems based on  feeding with plant proteins rather than fishmeal. Trials at a commercial farm near Banket, Zimbabwe showed that all-male <i>T. rendalli</i> populations in cages fed with pelleted feeds grew as well as <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under similar conditions.

Large adults feed on pelagic prey (anchovies, sardines, myctophiids, bregmacerotids, carangoids, sphyraenids, atherinids, sciaenids, <i>Scomber</i>, <i>Trichiurus</i>, squid and crustaceans, etc.) near the surface during daytime and migrate to the bottom at night.

In Western North Atlantic, it undergoes ontogenetic shift in the diet associated with the transition from oceanic to coastal habitats. Pelagic juveniles feed mainly on copepods prior to entry to the estuary, and primarily on fishes after entry to estuary (Ref. 12139). Tailor populations in South Africa and North America display definite seasonal migratory patterns, moving from higher latitudes to sub-tropical waters in winter (Ref. 1120, 6845).

Feces of pike are avoided by other fish because they contain alarm pheromones.  Deposits feces at specific locations, distant from its foraging area (Ref. 59043).  Eggs and young are preyed upon by fishes, aquatic insect larvae, birds, and aquatic mammals (Ref. 1998).  Does not generally undertake long migrations, but a few may move considerable distances (Ref. 27547).  Oviparous (Ref. 205). This fish can be heavily infested with parasites, including the broad tapeworm which, if not killed by thorough cooking, can infect human; is used as an intermediate host by a cestode parasite which results to large losses in usable catches of lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>) in some areas; also suffers from a trematode which causes unsightly cysts on the skin (Ref. 9988).  Excellent food fish; utilized fresh and frozen; eaten pan-fried, broiled, and baked (Ref. 9988).  Valuable game fish (Ref. 5723).  In spite of numerous attempts to culture this species, it was never entirely domesticated and does not accept artificial food (Ref. 30578).  Locally impacted by habitat alterations (Ref. 59043).",NA,0.5157,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,10,2012-06-25T00:00:00Z,97,2003-01-14T00:00:00Z,NA,258

Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30Â°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25Â°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712).

Found in all rivers where temperature rises above 10Â° C for about 3 months per year and does not exceed 20Â° C for more than a few weeks in summer (Ref. 59043) (preferred temperatures 4-12Â°C). Juveniles may live in cold lakes in northern Europe (Ref. 59043). Parr (i.e. juveniles) are territorial and are found in the upper reaches of rivers and streams, in riffle areas with strong current and rough gravel bottoms (Ref. 7471). During winter, parr seek refuge in small spaces or under stones during the day (Refs. 59043, 89461). Young remain in freshwater for 1 to 6 years, then migrate to coastal marine waters or even to open oceans where they remain for 1 to 4 years before returning to freshwater  for spawning (Ref. 51442). Adults inhabit cooler waters with strong to moderate flow (Ref. 44894). The Atlantic salmon is reported to live up to 10 years, but most individuals only reach 4-6 years (Ref. 88187). Juveniles feed mainly on aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans and fish; adults at sea feed on squids, shrimps, and fish (Ref. 51442). Most populations depend mostly or exclusively on stocking due to degradations of environmental conditions.  Fishing pressure on wild stocks has decreased due to intensive farming but other problems have increased. Farmed salmons escape in large numbers and move to any river and hybridize with wild stocks (Ref. 59043). This species may hybridize with trout (Salmo trutta) (Ref. 59043). Diseases of the species include furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida), corynebacterial kidney disease (Renibacterium salmoninarum), enteric red mouth disease (Yersinia ruckeri), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, bacterial kidney disease, fin rot and fungus infections (Ref. 5951).

In southeastern Australian waters, sharp temperature and salinity gradients across oceanic fronts provide favourable conditions for concentrations of broadbill swordfish (Ref. 6390).  Little is known of large scale movements by adult broadbill swordfish. Mature fish make only limited local movements (Ref. 9742). Tracking of fish using acoustic tags has shown that broadbill swordfish typically move to surface waters at night and inhabit deeper waters during the day, reaching depths up to 600 m (Ref. 30447). These vertical movements may be rapid and involve changes in waters temperature as great as 19Â°C (Ref. 6390). Some tagged fish spend daylight hours near the sea bed close to the continental shelf break or submerged banks and move offshore at night (Ref. 6390). In the eastern Pacific broadbill swordfish are commonly seen basking at the sea surface for short periods during the day, a behaviour that may allow the fish to recover from stress associated with low temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in deep water (Ref. 30447). Broadbill swordfish are normally solitary, but pairs of fish are regularly observed at the surface off the Californian coast (Ref. 30447).
Larvae are most common within a few m of the surface during the day but may move to depths of 30 m at night (Ref. 30448). Swordfish larvae longer than 10 mm feed almost exclusively on larvae of other fish species (Ref. 6390).  Young swordfish is preyed upon by blue shark, tuna and marlins.

Migrate toward temperate or cold waters in the summer and back to warm waters in the fall.  Adults are opportunistic feeders, known to forage for their food from the surface to the bottom over a wide depth range (Ref. 9702).  Feed mainly on fishes (Atlantic mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, redfish, herring and lanternfishes (Ref. 5951)) but also on crustaceans and squids (Ref. 9354).

Spawning takes place in Atlantic during spring in southern Sargasso Sea.  Migrate to cooler waters to feed (Ref. 4689).  Females grow fastest.  Determination of age is difficult since the otoliths are very small and scales are missing in adults.  Year rings have been successfully counted on cross sections of the fin rays (Ref. 35388).  Pelagic eggs measure 1.6-1.8mm and the newly hatched larvae is 4 mm long.  Sword is well developed at a length of 10mm and young live pelagically in the upper water layers where they quickly develop into very voracious predators (Ref. 35388).

In the northeastern Pacific, they tend to migrate northward along the coast of Baja California and California, USA from June to September. Off the Pacific coast of Japan they migrate northward in summer and southward during winter. Large fish may enter the Sea of Japan from the south in early summer and move as far north as the Okhotsk Sea, most leave the Sea of Japan through Tsugara Strait, north of Honshu. Variations in the food spectrum are attributed primarily to behavioral differences in feeding: 'vigorous pursuit' would be required on small schooling fishes (anchovies, sauries, hakes) or on squids, while 'modified filter-feeding' is used to feed on red crabs and other less agile organisms (Ref. 168).

Undertakes migrations with mean distances of 54-117 km per month; shows a clear annual migration cycle (Ref. 89017, 89018), moves from deeper offshore waters (10-30 m) in autumn and winter to shallower areas (<10 m) in spring (Ref. 82319). Young are non-migratory, inhabiting inshore nursery grounds (Ref. 89019, 89020, 89022); in the Bay of Douarnenez (France) they are found to remain in shallow waters for at least 2 years (Ref. 89023). Oviparous. Young may tend to follow large objects, such as their mother (Ref. 205).

But permanently resident populations also seem to exist. The resident fish simply disperse from the reefs after spawning, while the migrating fish move up to 1000 nautical miles to the south (Ref. 30203). On the Queensland east coast, migration from the Lizard Island-Townsville area takes place ater the spawning season when a significant proportion of 2 and 3-year-old fish moves southwards. A return migration of 3 and 4-year-old fish comences during winter (Ref. 30199). On the west coast, the mackerel follow the 22-24Â°C isotherm (Ref. 30205), generally moving south in the late summer and north during the winter.
The migration route in the Gulf of Thailand has been mapped (Ref. 6783). Feeding apparently occurs day and night.
In north Queensland, small juveniles up to 10 m FL live in creeks, estuaries and along areas of sheltered mud flats in the early wet season (December-January) (Ref. 30194). Juveniles of 15-40 cm FL are caught by prawn trawlers working shallow water during February and March (Ref. 30194). After May, Spanish mackerel of about 40 cm FL are caught in reef waters in the commecial hook-and-line fishery (Ref. 30194).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58534,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1990-10-19T00:00:00Z,1472,2007-09-05T00:00:00Z,711,2001-11-21T00:00:00Z,121,Scomberomorus,commerson,168,"(LacepÃ¨de, 1800)",Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel,Sccom_ue.jpg,NA,NA,NA,416,Scombrinae,2960,NA,fusiform / normal,R,NA,NA,0,0,0,-1,pelagic-neritic,oceanodromous,51243,10,70,12260,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41.18,240.0,FL,NA,NA,5765,120.0,TL,NA,NA,5450,7e4,NA,5765,SCCOM_U2,NA,NA,NA,4931,highly commercial,very high,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,NA,"from 100,000 to 500,000","Indon., Phil., India, Oman",gillnets,drift gillnets (GND),-1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,never/rarely,NA,NA,never/rarely,NA,never/rarely,NA,NA,-1,4699,reports of ciguatera poisoning,168,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"Distributed from near edge of continental shelf to shallow coastal waters, often of low salinity and high turbidity (Ref. 30199, 48637).

 <p>
<b>Common names</b>: English, Hindi and Punjabi - rohu;  Bengali-rui; Burmese- nga-myit-chin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0Â°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9Â°C; reproduces between 22-31.0Â°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.

Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - catla; Hindi-bhakur, catla; Bengali-katal; Punjabi-theila;    Burmese - nga-thaing
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>:  Catla is distributed the rivers of the Indo-Gangetic system in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal.  It is a very popular food fish.  It was introduced between 1904 and 1921 from the river Godavari to the canals, rivers and reservoirs of southern India and during 1930's and 40's to Maharashtra (Powai Lake, Mumbai) and to Kerala (Periyar Lake).  It has also been introduced to other countries, including Japan, the Philippines and the former USSR (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :  There are no reliable statistics on production of catla from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maurituis, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> : Tropics; hardy;  natural temperature range 18-300C; lower and upper thermal tolerance limits, 16.7Â°C and 39.5Â°C; sensitive to low oxygen conditions; tolerates pH 6.5-8.5 and  salinity up to 5 ppt; prefers deep pools; breeds during the southwest monsoon (May - September) in water temperatures around 24 - 31Â°C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Catla breeds naturally in flooded fields and can also be bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.  Catla is now mostly spawned artificially in hatcheries. It is more difficult to spawn than most other carps, and requires good broodstock management.  This is sometimes lacking on farms. The postlarvae called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn' in English.   Catla attain first maturity when about two years old and 442 mm length (Natarajan and Jhingran, 1963).  In nature, they spawn only once during the breeding season but have been spawned up to four times in hatcheries (Gupta et al. 1995).  Fecundity depends on the age, length and weight of the fish and the weight of the ovaries and varies from 0.2 to 4.2 million n fishes weighing between 11.3 to 18.4 Kg fish.  The number of eggs/kg body weight of fish from well-managed broodstock is about 100,000.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to females. A female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.  The yolk-sac is absorbed after three days.
 <p>
The postlarvae are easy to handle and cheap to transport, packed in plastic bags with oxygen.  The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, postlarvae have a survival of 60 - 70%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to fingerlings for stocking in growout ponds or other waters.
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are limed and fertilized before stocking with carp fingerlings at 5,000-10,000/ha. The proportion of catla in the stocked population is 10-35% depending upon the species mix used for polyculture. In polyculture of Indian major carps alone, the proportion of catla can be 30-35%, but in polyculture with exotic carps, the proportion of catla is reduced to 10%, with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) constituting 20% of the total population. The ponds are fertilized every two weeks with cow manure, or a combination of inorganic fertilizers.  <p>Supplementary feed, comprising a 50:50 mixture of oil cake : cereal  bran is provided daily at 2-3% body weight based on the growth registered every month. Its contribution to total production ranges from 10-30%.  Monoculture of catla is not practiced.
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b>:  Some reservoirs in India produce large-sized catla (35-40 kg in weight) which have a special market during the marriage season. Catla has a large sized head, but is otherwise  highly suitable for filleting.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  Catla is a very important species for aquaculture. Seed production currently falls far short of demand. If the availability of catla seed increases and if growth rates can be further improved through genetic enhancement, the contribution of catla to aquaculture production in the Indian subcontinent will increase, with a decline in the importance of silver carp in carp polyculture systems.  Catla also has good potential for processing into fillets and other valued-added products for export.
 <p>
Intergeneric hybrids of catla with Indian and other carp species have been produced (Tripathi 1992) of which the rohu female x catla male hybrid combines the advantages of the deep body of the catla and the small head rohu.  This hybrid is fertile. Naturally occurring catla x rohu hybrids have been found in the Rihand reservoir.

Though they occur naturally in open river systems they are never known to dominate the environment.  Larger fish generally  frequent deeper waters.  Common carp are acclimated to a variety of habitats and extremes of environment, eg high salinities and low oxygen concentrations (Ref. 6390).  They have been observed to gulp air at the surface of oxygen-depleted waters (Ref. 30478).  During winter carp go into deeper water which will be comparatively warmer than water in shallow areas.
They are now established in the wild in Zimbabwe (Ref. 4967).
Common carps are active swimmers that can leap obstacles up to 1 meter high and negotiate torrential flows (Ref. 2906).

Normally inhabit waters with surface temperatures of 20Â°C to 30Â°C (Ref. 28951). However, adults are sometimes present in waters as cold as 15Â°C (Ref. 168, 28950). Stay near the surface at night. School near the surface with birds, drifting objects, whales, sharks, and other tuna species and shows characteristic behaviors like jumping, feeding and foaming. Opportunistic feeders preying on any forage available. The feeding activity peaks in the early morning and in the late afternoon.
Skipjack tuna also need a dissolved oxygen level of 2.5 ml per liter of sea water to maintain a minimum swimming speed, and require higher levels when active (Ref. 28952). This requirement generally restricts skipjack tuna to water above the thermocline and in some areas, such as the eastern Pacific, may exclude them from surface waters (Ref. 28952).
The warm East Australian Current distributes skipjack tuna larvae into subtropical waters off eastern Australia (Ref. 28956). The larvae are generally limited to the upper 50 m of water and are most common in the sub-surface layers (Ref. 6390). Juvenile skipjack tuna less than 15 cm TL inhabit the same areas as larvae but generally move to cooler waters as they grow to maturity (Ref. 28956).
There is little information on migration patterns for skipjack tuna in Australian waters. Skipjack tuna tagged in the Coral Sea, off Norfolk Island and off New South Wales have been recovered in waters off the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, French Polynesia and New Zealand (Ref. 28959). The recapture in Australian waters of a few fish tagged in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea indicates that there could also be significant movement of skipjack tuna into the Australian Fishing Zone from the greater South Pacific (Ref. 6390).",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1990-10-19T00:00:00Z,309,2008-07-31T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,107,Katsuwonus,pelamis,168,"(Linnaeus, 1758)",Skipjack tuna,Kapel_m0.jpg,NA,NA,NA,416,Scombrinae,4643,NA,fusiform / normal,R,NA,NA,0,0,0,-1,pelagic-oceanic,oceanodromous,NA,0,260,9340,0,NA,55287,12.0,168,NA,NA,40.19,110.0,FL,NA,NA,89423,80.0,FL,NA,NA,168,34500.0,NA,168,KAPEL_U0,NA,NA,NA,4931,highly commercial,high,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,NA,"more than 500,000",Mostly Japan (FAO fishing area 61); also 67.,seines,purse seines (PS),-1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,never/rarely,NA,NA,never/rarely,NA,never/rarely,NA,NA,-1,4699,reports of ciguatera poisoning,4690,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"Found in offshore waters; larvae restricted to waters with surface temperatures of 15Â°C to 30Â°C (Ref. 6390).

Albacore tend to concentrate along thermal discontinuities such as the Transition Zone in the north Pacific and the Kuroshio Front east of Japan because of richer forage organisms but poorer in oxygen content. Albacore migrate within water masses rather than across temperature and oxygen boundaries. Minimum oxygen requirements are probably about 2 ml/l. At least two stocks (northern and southern) are believed to exist in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Feed during the day and at night (diurnal and nocturnal).
The migration pattern of albacore in the south Pacific Ocean has recently been described (Ref. 30272). Juveniles move from the tropics into temperate waters and then eastwards along the subtropical convergence zone. At maturity, albacore return to the tropics but go back to temperate waters after spawning (Ref. 6390).
In Australian waters, larvae are present on the North West shelf all summer, but are present off north-eastern Australia mainly between October and December (Ref. 30274). Juveniles are found off New South Wales from September to November, and during summer they follow the warmer waters of the East Australian Current southwards (Ref. 6390). Albacore may reach eastern Tasmanian waters by December, where they remain until about April (Ref. 6390). As autumn approaches and warm waters recede, the juveniles move northwards and are present again off New South Wales until May (Ref. 30278).

Trans-Atlantic movements related to feeding have been reported; juveniles originating from the Mediterranean Sea found in foraging grounds in the eastern coast of the USA (88870), conversely, juveniles originating from the western Atlantic have been found in foraging grounds in the central North Atlantic (88868). In the northeastern Pacific, they tend to migrate northward along the coast of Baja California and California, USA from June to September. Off the Pacific coast of Japan they migrate northward in summer and southward during winter. Large fish may enter the Sea of Japan from the south in early summer and move as far north as the Okhotsk Sea, most leave the Sea of Japan through Tsugara Strait, north of Honshu. Variations in the food spectrum are attributed primarily to behavioral differences in feeding: 'vigorous pursuit' would be required on small schooling fishes (anchovies, sauries, hakes) or on squids, while 'modified filter-feeding' is used to feed on red crabs and other less agile organisms (Ref. 168).

<p>
<b>Common names</b>: English - milkfish ; Hawaiian - pua awa, awa ; Japanese -  sabahii ; Indonesian - bandeng, golu ; Tagalog (Philippines) - bangus ,  sabalo (for adult fish); 
<p>
<b>History of use</b>: Native to the tropical (and parts of the Northern sub-tropical) Indo-Pacific; used for centuries as a foodfish in Southeast Asia and Oceania; farmed in ponds and coastal enclosures for at least 700 years in Indonesia, 400 in the Philippines and Taiwan and 300 in Hawaii;  farming has been based, until recently, entirely on the capture of wild fry.
<p>
<b>Production statistics</b>: According to FAO (1997) the leading countries in production of farmed milkfish are Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan which produced about 157,000, 151,000 and 63,000 t respectively in 1995.  Production of farmed milkfish occurs on a much smaller scale in some Pacific islands; for example in 1995, Guam 25 t, Kiribati 50 t. Milkfish  production  increased continuously until the late 1980's but declined during early 1990's mainly because of detoriation of spawning grounds (reefs), nursery  grounds (mangrove areas) and fry collecting grounds (sandy coast lines)  (SEAFDEC 1995). Moreover, many pond owners then changed to shrimp farming.
<p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Regions - mainly Southeast Asia, FAO Area 04-, Asia, Inland; also to a minor extent Oceania, FAO Areas - 71, 77.
<p>
<b>Countries</b>:   Federated States of Micronesia (Guam), Indonesia, Kiribati, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand.
<p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Milkfish, except for spawning adults  and the early larval stages, have very wide ranges of environmental tolerance (Schuster 1960, Gordon and Hong 1986, Bagarinao 1991). Most juvenile stages tolerate low temperatures of 14 to 18 Â°C and high temperatures of 38 to 41 Â°C.  In the  Philippines wet season (May to October), milkfish pond temperatures range from 25 to 34Â°C, salinities from 15 to 25 ppt and dissolved oxygen from 4 to 11 ppm.  In the dry season (November to April) there are similar  fluctuations, but temperatures stay below 30Â°C from November to December and  peak in February and March, sometimes exceeding 35Â°C and with concurrent  salinities up to 40 ppt (Juliano 1985; Sumagaysay 1994). Milkfish, except for spawning adults and early land stages, are remarkably euryhaline and tolerate all salinities from freshwater to hypersaline lagoons.  The pH preferred by milkfish is around pH 8.0 and more acidic waters such as ponds that are affected by acid sulphate sorts can depress growth and survival.
<p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Milkfish fry are still mainly caught from shallow inshore waters.  Historically, catches of wild fry have been huge: reaching over 1 billion annually in the Philippines and 700 to 800 million in Indonesia. However, artificial propagation and hatchery operations are being developed to avoid the unpredictable nature of supplies of fry from the wild (Duray 1996).
<p>
During the 1980's, the first spontaneous maturation of hatchery-bred milkfish in captivity was observed after 3.5 to 5.5 years of rearing spawners in net cages (Marte and Lacanilao 1986). Subsequent efforts have been made to induce spawning using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-A).  In the Philippines, hatchery-bred fish have spawned spontaneously in net cages and concrete tanks, producing 50,000 to 956,000 eggs per spawning (Emata 1995). Milkfish farming in Taiwan  is now based almost entirely on hatchery-raised fry. Hatchery production stabilises the supply of fry and can promote increased production of milkfish. A milkfish hatchery needs larval rearing tanks, culture tanks for rotifers (Brachionus) and green algae (Chlorella), and hatching tanks for brine shrimp (Artemia).  Milkfish eggs are collected from broodstock cages and  hatching occurs after 14-16 hours (at 28-29Â°C) after collection.  Hatching tanks have about 300 eggs per liter for maximum hatching success.  
<p>
To obtain an optimum survival of 30-40%, larval rearing tanks are stocked at a density of 30 larvae per liter, with moderate aeration (23-33Â°C, 30-40 ppt).   A 'green water' technique is used, with Chlorella added in the morning, before feeding the larvae.  Starting on day 2 until day 21 larvae are fed with rotifers.  From day 15 to day 21, additional <i>Artemia nauplii</i> are added.  Water exchange in the rearing tanks is 30% from day 2 until 14, 50 - 70% from day 15-21. 
<p>
Rearing milkfish larvae to fry also conducted in ponds. Nursery ponds are dried, limed and fertilised with1 to 3 t.ha-1 of chicken manure or  0.5 to 1.0 t.ha-1 of rice bran to develop natural foods.   The water depth is gradually increased to 30 cm before stocking fry at 30 to 50 per m2 (Baliao 1984). Postlarvae begin to feed shortly after the eyes have become fully pigmented and before the yolk is completely resorbed. Unfed larvae all die about 150h from hatching at rearing temperatures of 25 to 27 Â°C. Postlarvae and fry are particulate, visual feeders on small live prey such as rotifers (Brachionus), cladocerans (Moina), harpacticoid copepods (Tisibintra) and brine shrimp (Artemia). When milkfish larvae are about 2 weeks old, they can take artificial feed.   Milkfish fry from artificial rearing on day 21 are at about the same developmental stages as wild caught fry.
<p>
Fry grow to 5 - 8 cm fingerlings in 4 to 6 weeks. Milkfish fingerlings are day-time feeders and take food mainly from the bottom. The kinds of food  ingested vary with location and fish size. Juveniles from natural habitats feed mainly on cyanobacteria, diatoms and detritus along with filamentous green algae and invertebrates such as small crustaceans and worms. Milkfish  tend to ingest the top layer of bottom sediments, with its associated micro - and meiofauna, as mullet do. Much of this material is detritus, rich in  bacterial protein, fungi, and protozoans.
<p>
Adult milkfish graze on surfaces and on floating algae and, like the juveniles, are opportunistic omnivores.  Growout of milkfish is evolving from traditional low intensity systems in shallow ponds based on natural food supply to more intensive systems in pens and deeper ponds with supplemental feeding  (Fortes 1986, Lee 1995, KÃ¼hlmann 1998). The former include the ""lab-lab"" culture system of the Philippines and the shallow water culture ponds of Taiwan. ""Lab-lab"" is a term used in the Philippines for algal mats and their associated biota. Traditional shallow ponds yield around 800 kg ha-1 yr-1 from three crops, whereas more intensive modular ponds can yield up to 200 kg ha-1 yr-1 from six to eight crops.  Using semi-intensive ponds, fertilised with chicken manure (2 to 3 t ha-1) and inorganic fertilisers (100 kg ha-1 ammonia phosphate, 10 kg ha-1 urea) and stocking densities up to 7,000 fish ha-1 in combination with  supplemental feeding at 4 % body weight have yielded 1,160 kg ha-1 per crop (Sumagaysay and Borlongan 1995). In the Philippines, growth rates are much higher in the wet season than in the dry season  (KÃ¼hlmann 1998).  Adult milkfish spawners can be kept on a diet of commercial pellets with about 42 % protein, given at 1.5 to 2 % of body weight twice daily, presented on a feeding tray.
<p>
Milkfish are normally farmed in monoculture but there is some polyculture to utilise ecological food niches more efficiently e.g. with crustaceans (<i>Penaeus indicus</i>, <i>Penaeus monodon</i>, <i>Scylla serrata</i>) or fish (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>; <i>Megalops cyprinoides</i>) (Eldani and Primavera 1981; Fortes 1984).
<p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:   The preferred market size for milkfish in Asia is  about 300 - 400 g, meaning fish of less than one year old.  Milkfish do not  reach sexual maturity until 5 - 7 years of age.  Milkfish is mainly sold  whole, fresh or frozen.  It has very limited market acceptability outside  the main countries for production, because of its many fine bones.  Producers of milkfish do not usually sell fish directly to consumers, but  instead deliver fish through co-operatives, brokers, dealers, collectors or  wholesalers, and retailers. The majority are sold at auctions, through  dealers, brokers, wholesalers or co-operatives to other dealers, and then to  retailers.  Milkfish are also processed by marinating, smoking, or canning  for export to Asian minorities; for example, to the USA.
<p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  The introduction of milkfish hatchery technology  will continue to have a positive net economic impact on farmed milkfish production, employment, and income, while removing the livelihoods of some wild fry collectors. Moreover, if the production efficiency of intensive and semi-intensive (Focken and Becker 1996) systems can be improved, farmed milkfish production is likely to increase. There is also scope for wider consumption of value-added products, such as canned milkfish.

Inhabit reservoirs, rivers, creeks, drains, swamps and tidal creeks; commonly over mud bottoms, often in well-vegetated areas (Ref. 44894).  Also found in warm weedy pools of sluggish streams, canals, and ponds (Ref. 5723).  Most common in blind estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 32693), but usually absent from permanently open estuaries and open sea (Ref. 6465) and from fast-flowing waters (Ref. 7248, 12501).  Normally not found at high altitudes (Ref. 6465).  Able to survive extreme reduction of temporary water bodies (Ref. 2, 27445).  Highly euryhaline (Ref. 2, 3, 23, 58, 61, 6465, 12501, 12522, 12524, 13337, 27445, 55352).  Grow and reproduce in fresh-, brackish and seawater (Ref. 2, 21, 23, 61, 5214, 27445, 36683, 54362).  Can be reared under hyper-saline conditions (Ref. 4537, 44894, 52307).  Tolerate low dissolved oxygen levels (Ref. 3, 23, 6465) and can utilise atmospheric oxygen when water oxygen levels drop (Ref. 61, 6465).  Mainly diurnal.  May form schools (Ref. 3, 4537, 44894).  Omnivorous (Ref. 21, 12524), feed mainly on algae and phytoplankton (Ref. 4537, 7248, 12501, 12522, 12524, 13337, 36683, 44894, 52307) but also take some zooplankton, small insects and their larvae (Ref. 4537, 7248, 12524, 13337, 44894, 52307), shrimps (Ref. 12524, 13337), earthworms (Ref. 12501) and aquatic macrophytes (Ref. 6465).  Juveniles carnivorous/omnivorous, adults tend to be herbivorous or detritus feeders (Ref. 2, 6465, 13517).  Large individuals have been reported to prey on small fishes (Ref. 2, 6465, 12501, 12522), and occasionally cannibalise their own young (Ref. 2, 6465).  Exhibit considerable plasticity in their feeding habits (Ref. 6465, 13544) as well as in their reproductive biology (Ref. 13544).  Polygamous (Ref. 12524, 13337), maternal mouthbrooder (Ref. 1, 5214, 12524, 13337).  Reach sexual maturity at 15 centimeter length (Ref. 44894), but stunted fish may breed at 6-7 centimeters and at an age of just over 2 months (Ref. 52307).  Fecundity high (Ref. 55352).  Extended temperature range 8-42 Â°C, natural temperature range 17-35Â°C (Ref. 3), with salinity-dependent difference in temperature tolerance (Ref. 2, 23).  Somewhat aggressive toward other species (Ref. 36683).  Marketed fresh and frozen (Ref. 9987).  Excellent palatability (Ref. 6465), with small head and large dress-out weight (Ref. 61), and filets without small bones (Ref. 57960).  Used extensively in biological, physiological and behavioural research (Ref. 7248).  Translocated and introduced for aquaculture, sport fishing, stocking man-made lakes and biological control of nuisance plants and animals (Ref. 6465).  Eurytopic; a most successful and vagile invader (Ref. 6465).",NA,0.5,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,2,2012-06-04T00:00:00Z,675,2011-05-28T00:00:00Z,NA,3

 <p>
<b>Common names</b>: English, Hindi and Punjabi - rohu;  Bengali-rui; Burmese- nga-myit-chin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0Â°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9Â°C; reproduces between 22-31.0Â°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.
 <p>
Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

In the past decade, a number of molecular works have shown that <i>T. chalcogramma</i> coud be deeply nested in a clade that contains the <i>Gadus</i> spp. 
It has been suggested that the species should be now assigned to <i>Gadus</i>, although none of these works had a conclusive statement with a complete taxonomic re-assessment. However, the name <i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i> may be used in scientific publications.  If the American Fisheries Society has endorsed that change in the latest edition of its list of fish names, FAO will not change it until a more stable consensus is reached.  Since this species is highly commercial, with a number of regulations and statistical reports using that name, it is preferable to change it with the strongest scientific support.  In addition, they are other taxonomic issue in that family, with the same issues about names. Therefore, for the use by the rest of the society, the fishery domain in particular, we recommend to continue using <i>T. chalcogramma</i> and wait that a complete revision of the family and thorough taxonomic and nomenclatural decisions are published.",10,0,-1,-1,benthopelagic,non-migratory,NA,183,1280,50550,NA,NA,NA,28.0,55701,NA,NA,46.5,91.0,TL,NA,NA,2850,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3850.0,NA,56335,THCHA_U0,NA,NA,NA,4931,highly commercial,low,Reliable: based on ex-vessel price for this species,As human food resource.,"more than 500,000",USA and Russia (Ref. 9988),trawls,bottom pair trawls (PTB),-1,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,never/rarely,NA,NA,never/rarely,NA,never/rarely,NA,4883,0,NA,harmless,NA,no special ability,NA,NA,-1,"The adults usually live near to the sea floor, but sometimes they also appear near the surface (Ref. 1371).

Fry may be preyed upon by birds and mammals while adults by marine mammals and large fish (Ref. 1998).  Mostly sold canned (Ref. 1998) but also utilized fresh, smoked, and frozen; also valued for caviar, especially in Japan; eaten steamed, fried, broiled, boiled, microwaved, and baked (Ref. 9988).

They feed in shallow (0.5-1.0 m deep) and warm (over 21Â°C) backwaters, lakes and flooded areas with slow current on phytoplankton and zooplankton (Ref. 30578, 10294).  Bigger individuals from about 1.5 cm SL feed only on phytoplankton while larvae and small juveniles prey on zooplankton (Ref. 59043).  Adults breed in rivers or tributaries over shallow rapids with gravel or sand bottom, in upper water layer or even at surface during floods when the water level increases by 50-120 cm above normal level.  Conditions for spawning include high current (0.5-1.7 m/s), turbid water, temperatures above 15Â°C (usually 18-26Â°C)  and high oxygen concentrations (Ref. 59043).  Spawning ceases if conditions change (especially sensitive to water-level fall) and resumes again when water level increases.  Juveniles and adults form large schools during spawning season.  Mature individuals undertake long distance upriver migration at start of a rapid flood and water-level increase, able to leap over obstacles up to 1 m.  After spawning, adults migrate to foraging habitats,  In autumn, adults move to deeper places in main course of river where they remain without feeding.  Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current (Ref. 59043).  In aquaculture, it can survive brackish water (up to 7 ppt) when released into estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 59043).  Escape from fish farms are widely known even as they are stocked in large rivers and almost all still water bodies like lakes and ponds.  Utilized fresh for human consumption and also introduced to many countries where its ability to clean reservoirs and other waters of clogging algae is appreciated even more than its food value (Ref. 9987).  One of among 3 or 4 species of cyprinids whose world production in aquaculture exceeds 1 million tons per year (Ref. 30578).",NA,0.625,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,2,2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,97,2003-01-03T00:00:00Z,NA,274

 <p>
<b>Common names</b>: English, Hindi and Punjabi - rohu;  Bengali-rui; Burmese- nga-myit-chin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0Â°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9Â°C; reproduces between 22-31.0Â°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.
 <p>
Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

They feed in shallow (0.5-1.0 m deep) and warm (over 21Â°C) backwaters, lakes and flooded areas with slow current on phytoplankton and zooplankton (Ref. 30578, 10294).  Bigger individuals from about 1.5 cm SL feed only on phytoplankton while larvae and small juveniles prey on zooplankton (Ref. 59043).  Adults breed in rivers or tributaries over shallow rapids with gravel or sand bottom, in upper water layer or even at surface during floods when the water level increases by 50-120 cm above normal level.  Conditions for spawning include high current (0.5-1.7 m/s), turbid water, temperatures above 15Â°C (usually 18-26Â°C)  and high oxygen concentrations (Ref. 59043).  Spawning ceases if conditions change (especially sensitive to water-level fall) and resumes again when water level increases.  Juveniles and adults form large schools during spawning season.  Mature individuals undertake long distance upriver migration at start of a rapid flood and water-level increase, able to leap over obstacles up to 1 m.  After spawning, adults migrate to foraging habitats,  In autumn, adults move to deeper places in main course of river where they remain without feeding.  Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current (Ref. 59043).  In aquaculture, it can survive brackish water (up to 7 ppt) when released into estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 59043).  Escape from fish farms are widely known even as they are stocked in large rivers and almost all still water bodies like lakes and ponds.  Utilized fresh for human consumption and also introduced to many countries where its ability to clean reservoirs and other waters of clogging algae is appreciated even more than its food value (Ref. 9987).  One of among 3 or 4 species of cyprinids whose world production in aquaculture exceeds 1 million tons per year (Ref. 30578).",NA,0.625,0,2,1990-10-17T00:00:00Z,2,2012-05-14T00:00:00Z,97,2003-01-03T00:00:00Z,NA,274

A second run in autumn; those fishes remain a year in rivers before spawning. Moves far upstream, sometimes our to 1500 km. Spawns in shallow tributaries with some current in well oxygenated water over gravel bottom. Individual females do not spawn every year; spawns only 2-3 times during entire life. After spawning adults return directly to sea. Embryonic development lasts up to 7 months. Alevins migrate downstream in May - June (Ref. 59043). Collected by fyke nets (Ref. 4526).

In spite of numerous attempts to culture this species, it was never entirely domesticated and does not accept artificial food (Ref. 30578).

They occur from estuaries of large lowland rivers as well as from small mountain streams, preferring deep waters in summer (Ref. 59043).
