Feeds on plant matter (e.g. leaves, weeds, <i>Ipomea reptans</i> and <i>Hydrilla</i>) and invertebrates (Ref. 4835).  A migratory species but not considered to be a long-distance migrant.  Regarded as local migrant which moves from the Mekong up into small streams and canals and onto flooded areas during the rainy season and back again during receding water (Ref. 37770).  Some reports indicated that upstream migration of this fish is triggered by the first rains and rising water levels.  When it finds a tributary, canal or stream it moves upstream and eventually onto flooded areas.  When water recedes, it migrates back into canals and streams and into the Mekong again (Ref. 37770).  Often used as a pituitary donor for artificial propagation in aquaculture.  Escapees from culture installations have become established in rivers and form the basis for capture fisheries on several Southeast Asian islands (Ref. 1739).  Useful in cropping excessive vegetation in reservoirs (Ref. 2686).  Used for lap pa (in the preparation of which the numerous small bones are ground fine) or grilled or used to make som pa.

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - catla; Hindi-bhakur, catla; Bengali-katal; Punjabi-theila;    Burmese - nga-thaing
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>:  Catla is distributed the rivers of the Indo-Gangetic system in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal.  It is a very popular food fish.  It was introduced between 1904 and 1921 from the river Godavari to the canals, rivers and reservoirs of southern India and during 1930's and 40's to Maharashtra (Powai Lake, Mumbai) and to Kerala (Periyar Lake).  It has also been introduced to other countries, including Japan, the Philippines and the former USSR (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :  There are no reliable statistics on production of catla from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maurituis, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> : Tropics; hardy;  natural temperature range 18-300C; lower and upper thermal tolerance limits, 16.7°C and 39.5°C; sensitive to low oxygen conditions; tolerates pH 6.5-8.5 and  salinity up to 5 ppt; prefers deep pools; breeds during the southwest monsoon (May - September) in water temperatures around 24 - 31°C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Catla breeds naturally in flooded fields and can also be bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.  Catla is now mostly spawned artificially in hatcheries. It is more difficult to spawn than most other carps, and requires good broodstock management.  This is sometimes lacking on farms. The postlarvae called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn' in English.   Catla attain first maturity when about two years old and 442 mm length (Natarajan and Jhingran, 1963).  In nature, they spawn only once during the breeding season but have been spawned up to four times in hatcheries (Gupta et al. 1995).  Fecundity depends on the age, length and weight of the fish and the weight of the ovaries and varies from 0.2 to 4.2 million n fishes weighing between 11.3 to 18.4 Kg fish.  The number of eggs/kg body weight of fish from well-managed broodstock is about 100,000.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to females. A female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.  The yolk-sac is absorbed after three days.
 <p>
The postlarvae are easy to handle and cheap to transport, packed in plastic bags with oxygen.  The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, postlarvae have a survival of 60 - 70%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to fingerlings for stocking in growout ponds or other waters.
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are limed and fertilized before stocking with carp fingerlings at 5,000-10,000/ha. The proportion of catla in the stocked population is 10-35% depending upon the species mix used for polyculture. In polyculture of Indian major carps alone, the proportion of catla can be 30-35%, but in polyculture with exotic carps, the proportion of catla is reduced to 10%, with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) constituting 20% of the total population. The ponds are fertilized every two weeks with cow manure, or a combination of inorganic fertilizers.  <p>Supplementary feed, comprising a 50:50 mixture of oil cake : cereal  bran is provided daily at 2-3% body weight based on the growth registered every month. Its contribution to total production ranges from 10-30%.  Monoculture of catla is not practiced.
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b>:  Some reservoirs in India produce large-sized catla (35-40 kg in weight) which have a special market during the marriage season. Catla has a large sized head, but is otherwise  highly suitable for filleting.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  Catla is a very important species for aquaculture. Seed production currently falls far short of demand. If the availability of catla seed increases and if growth rates can be further improved through genetic enhancement, the contribution of catla to aquaculture production in the Indian subcontinent will increase, with a decline in the importance of silver carp in carp polyculture systems.  Catla also has good potential for processing into fillets and other valued-added products for export.
 <p>
Intergeneric hybrids of catla with Indian and other carp species have been produced (Tripathi 1992) of which the rohu female x catla male hybrid combines the advantages of the deep body of the catla and the small head rohu.  This hybrid is fertile. Naturally occurring catla x rohu hybrids have been found in the Rihand reservoir.

Bigger individuals from about 1.5 cm SL feed only on phytoplankton while larvae and small juveniles prey on zooplankton (Ref. 59043).  Adults breed in rivers or tributaries over shallow rapids with gravel or sand bottom, in upper water layer or even at surface during floods when the water level increases by 50-120 cm above normal level.  Conditions for spawning include high current (0.5-1.7 m/s), turbid water, temperatures above 15°C (usually 18-26°C)  and high oxygen concentrations (Ref. 59043).  Spawning ceases if conditions change (especially sensitive to water-level fall) and resumes again when water level increases.  Juveniles and adults form large schools during spawning season.  Mature individuals undertake long distance upriver migration at start of a rapid flood and water-level increase, able to leap over obstacles up to 1 m.  After spawning, adults migrate to foraging habitats,  In autumn, adults move to deeper places in main course of river where they remain without feeding.  Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current (Ref. 59043).  In aquaculture, it can survive brackish water (up to 7 ppt) when released into estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 59043).  Escape from fish farms are widely known even as they are stocked in large rivers and almost all still water bodies like lakes and ponds.

<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9°C; reproduces between 22-31.0°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.
 <p>
Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

Omnivorous (Ref. 6459), feeding on fish and crustaceans as well as on vegetable debris (Ref. 12693).  A migratory species, moving upstream of the Mekong from unknown rearing areas to spawn in unknown areas in May-July and returning to the mainstream when the river waters fall seeking rearing habitats in September -December (Ref. 37772).  South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs from October to February, with peak in November-December.  This migration is triggered by receding water and appears to be a dispersal migration following the lateral migration from flooded areas back into the Mekong at the end of the flood season.  Downstream migration takes place from May to August from Stung Treng to Kandal in Cambodia and further into the Mekong Delta in Viet Nam.  The presence of eggs during March to August from Stung Treng to Kandal indicates that the downstream migration is both a spawning and a trophic migration eventually bringing the fish into floodplain areas in Cambodia and Viet Nam during the flood season (Ref. 37770).  Common in the lower Mekong, where the young are collected for rearing in floating fish cages.
