Epipelagic (Ref. 58426).  The fish that stay more than two years in fresh water and become sexually ripe without ever going to sea, are called residuals; they never spawn (Ref. 27547). Young fish in lakes and rivers eat mainly insects; they stay almost entirely in deep parts of the river and soon become strongly territorial (Ref. 27547). Upon reaching the sea, the smolts remain close to the coast for a certain time, eating planktonic crustaceans (Ref. 27547). As they grow, they migrate farther out into the sea and hunt larger organisms (Ref. 27547) such as jellyfish, squids and fishes (Ref. 58426).  They are hunted by various fishes, birds (mergansers, loons and kingfishers), mammals and lampreys (Ref. 1998).  This kind is traded as fresh fish, dried or salted, smoked, canned, preserved and frozen (Ref. 9988).  They are steamed, grilled, broiled, cooked in the microwave and baked (Ref. 9988).

There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).  The sockeye is one of the most commercially important Pacific salmons; the kokanee is primarily a sport fish but also makes excellent food and in some areas well regarded as food for large trout (Ref. 27547).

Upon emerging from the gravel, fry immediately move downstream and remain inshore for a few months before going out to sea.  Fry may feed on nymphal and larval insects while in fresh water, but may not feed at all.

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - catla; Hindi-bhakur, catla; Bengali-katal; Punjabi-theila;    Burmese - nga-thaing
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>:  Catla is distributed the rivers of the Indo-Gangetic system in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal.  It is a very popular food fish.  It was introduced between 1904 and 1921 from the river Godavari to the canals, rivers and reservoirs of southern India and during 1930's and 40's to Maharashtra (Powai Lake, Mumbai) and to Kerala (Periyar Lake).  It has also been introduced to other countries, including Japan, the Philippines and the former USSR (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :  There are no reliable statistics on production of catla from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maurituis, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> : Tropics; hardy;  natural temperature range 18-300C; lower and upper thermal tolerance limits, 16.7°C and 39.5°C; sensitive to low oxygen conditions; tolerates pH 6.5-8.5 and  salinity up to 5 ppt; prefers deep pools; breeds during the southwest monsoon (May - September) in water temperatures around 24 - 31°C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Catla breeds naturally in flooded fields and can also be bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.  Catla is now mostly spawned artificially in hatcheries. It is more difficult to spawn than most other carps, and requires good broodstock management.  This is sometimes lacking on farms. The postlarvae called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn' in English.   Catla attain first maturity when about two years old and 442 mm length (Natarajan and Jhingran, 1963).  In nature, they spawn only once during the breeding season but have been spawned up to four times in hatcheries (Gupta et al. 1995).  Fecundity depends on the age, length and weight of the fish and the weight of the ovaries and varies from 0.2 to 4.2 million n fishes weighing between 11.3 to 18.4 Kg fish.  The number of eggs/kg body weight of fish from well-managed broodstock is about 100,000.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to females. A female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.  The yolk-sac is absorbed after three days.
 <p>
The postlarvae are easy to handle and cheap to transport, packed in plastic bags with oxygen.  The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, postlarvae have a survival of 60 - 70%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to fingerlings for stocking in growout ponds or other waters.
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are limed and fertilized before stocking with carp fingerlings at 5,000-10,000/ha. The proportion of catla in the stocked population is 10-35% depending upon the species mix used for polyculture. In polyculture of Indian major carps alone, the proportion of catla can be 30-35%, but in polyculture with exotic carps, the proportion of catla is reduced to 10%, with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) constituting 20% of the total population. The ponds are fertilized every two weeks with cow manure, or a combination of inorganic fertilizers.  <p>Supplementary feed, comprising a 50:50 mixture of oil cake : cereal  bran is provided daily at 2-3% body weight based on the growth registered every month. Its contribution to total production ranges from 10-30%.  Monoculture of catla is not practiced.
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b>:  Some reservoirs in India produce large-sized catla (35-40 kg in weight) which have a special market during the marriage season. Catla has a large sized head, but is otherwise  highly suitable for filleting.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  Catla is a very important species for aquaculture. Seed production currently falls far short of demand. If the availability of catla seed increases and if growth rates can be further improved through genetic enhancement, the contribution of catla to aquaculture production in the Indian subcontinent will increase, with a decline in the importance of silver carp in carp polyculture systems.  Catla also has good potential for processing into fillets and other valued-added products for export.
 <p>
Intergeneric hybrids of catla with Indian and other carp species have been produced (Tripathi 1992) of which the rohu female x catla male hybrid combines the advantages of the deep body of the catla and the small head rohu.  This hybrid is fertile. Naturally occurring catla x rohu hybrids have been found in the Rihand reservoir.

If the American Fisheries Society has endorsed that change in the latest edition of its list of fish names, FAO will not change it until a more stable consensus is reached.  Since this species is highly commercial, with a number of regulations and statistical reports using that name, it is preferable to change it with the strongest scientific support.

 <p>
<b>Common names</b>: English, Hindi and Punjabi - rohu;  Bengali-rui; Burmese- nga-myit-chin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b>: Distributed across the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and also in the Irrawady and its tributaries in Myanmar.  <i>Labeo rohita</i> is the most highly valued of all carp species farmed using traditional or newly-developed aquaculture systems in the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to other areas of India beyond its natural range for aquaculture in ponds, and reservoirs (Jagannatham 1946; Thyagarajan and Chacko 1950) and also to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (David 1983). Because of its fast growth and high quality flesh, it has also been introduced to other countries, including the former USSR, Japan and the Philippines (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production statistics</b>:  There are no reliable statistics on production of rohu from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia, Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>:  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myamar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Tropics; hardy, thrives well below an altitude of 550 m at temperatures ranging from 16.8 - 37.0°C; minimum tolerable temperature 13.9°C; reproduces between 22-31.0°C; tolerates salinity levels of 5 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, rohu seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers and or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs. Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).
 <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also  commonly called 'spawn'. After absorption of the yolk-sac, 3-day old postlarvae are ready for long-distance transport, rearing in nurseries or direct stocking in ponds prepared for aquaculture.   For example, beel nurseries, each measuring over 50 ha, are stocked with carp seed (including rohu) in Bangladesh.
 <p>
Rohu attain maturity when two to three years old (900 - 1,500 g) in India and spawn (only once a year in nature) during the south-west monsoon (July - August). However, the same females can be spawned two to three times in hatcheries, both before and after the monsoon, in addition to the normal spawning. The mature ovaries constitute about 10-20% of the body weight of the female.  A 1-kg female usually releases about 100,000 - 200,000 eggs.
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland extract (2-3 mg and 5 - 8 mg/kg body weight) are given to  females at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. A female and two males in a running water spawning tank should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is then stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males.  The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs, depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 28oC (Chaudhuri 1963).
 <p>
The postlarvae feed exclusively on zooplankton - rotifers and small cladocerans.  Nursery ponds (about 400 m2,  1m deep) are prepared by liming and fertilization with cow manure or poultry litter.  Prior to stocking, large copepods and various insects (especially notonectids) and their larvae are predators on the postlarvae and are eradicated from the nursery ponds with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  The postlarvae are given supplementary feed (a fine powder comprising a 50:50 mixture of groundnut or mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran) daily at two, three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the amount at five-day intervals. Stocked at 5 million/ha, the postlarvae can grow to fry of about 25 mm in 15 days, with a survival of over 60%. The fry are then transferred to rearing ponds (800 - 1200m2, 1.5m deep) for raising to early (50-70 mm) or advanced (100-125 mm) fingerlings or to early juveniles (150 - 200 mm):  the stocking material for small or seasonal ponds, perennial ponds and reservoirs respectively.
 <p>
The feeding habits of rohu fry change when they have reached 25 mm in length.  Consumption of rotifers and cladocerans drops to about 10% and they start to feed on unicellular algae (15%) and decaying vegetation (55%), the latter increasing in proportion as they grow further. Fry of about 200 mg are stocked at 100,000 - 125,000/ha, usually as a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The proportion of rohu is about 30-35%.  <p> Supplementary feed (the 1:1 cake-bran mixture) is given to fry stocked in rearing ponds, at a daily rate equal to their body weight for the first month, followed by twice their body weight/day in the second and third months.
 <p>
Grow-out ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are prepared by liming and fertilization. Predators and weeds are eliminated before stocking. Monoculture of rohu is not economical and a cheap, balanced diet for rohu  has yet to be produced commercially.  Rohu is usually grown in South Asia as 20 - 25% of polycultures that comprise three to six species of Indian major and Chinese carps, and in other countries with  various local species. Rohu is a midwater and marginal feeder, browsing on periphyton, decaying vegetation and debris. Experimental intensive aquaculture systems based on stocking  85% indigenous Indian carps with 10% silver carp and 5% grass carp have given annual production of 15 t/ha   (Tripathi et al. 1994).
 <p>
In Andhra Pradesh, India, over 100,000 ha of ricefields have been converted into fish ponds since the 1980's.  For  large ponds (1-4 ha, 1.5 - 3.0 m deep) the stocking density is around 10,000 fingerlings (>150 mm)/ha comprising rohu (70%), catla (20%) and mrigal (10%).  Even at this high density, rohu attains a weight of 1 kg in about an year. The fish are fed initially on rice bran alone and later on rice bran and oilcake (40:60).
 <p>
At least six intergeneric and five interspecific hybrids employing either male or female rohu have been produced experimentally (Khan and Jhingran 1975, Tripathi 1992). Hybrids of rohu with Chinese carps are short-lived, and the male common carp female rohu hybrid is sterile. The male catla x female rohu hybrid is fertile and combines the deep body of catla and the small head of rohu: characteristics preferred by some farmers.  Catla-rohu hybrids are also found in the seed produced from dry bundhs.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:  Rohu is usually marketed at 1 kg or above; fresh or packed in ice and transported to distant markets. The fish from Andhra Pradesh are transported to Calcutta - a distance of about one thousand kilometers - from where they are airlifted to markets in Assam and the north-eastern states of India. The fish are also sold in Dhaka (Bangladesh).  Rohu has also been exported recently to Canada, the middle East and the U.K., though on a small scale, for Bengali citizens.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>: Rohu is likely to become an even more important aquaculture species in near future, once research on selective breeding of rohu in India lead to the availability of the seed of faster growing strains. With further studies on feed development, monoculture of rohu in cages, pens, running waters and closed recirculatory systems might be possible. Both fresh and processed rohu might then become significant commodities, with much wider markets.

Isotope analysis has shown that shortfin mako is the highest level fish predator in oceanic waters off eastern Australia (Ref. 86961).  Adults feed on bony fishes, other sharks (Ref. 5578), cephalopods; larger individuals may feed on larger prey such as billfish and small cetaceans (Ref. 6871, 58048).

They occur from estuaries of large lowland rivers as well as from small mountain streams, preferring deep waters in summer (Ref. 59043).  They seek shelter under rocks, in crevices on the river banks, among roots of trees and dense vegetation (Ref. 30578, 10294).  Those in rivers tend to congregate in deep holes throughout the year, except at spawning (Ref. 27547).  Movements into shallower water during summer nights are related to feeding (Ref. 1998).  Smaller individuals feed on insect larvae, crayfish, mollusks and other invertebrates with a changing preference for fishes in larger individuals (Ref. 1998, 10294).

 <p>
<b>Common names</b> : English - mrigal; Bengali-mirka, mrigal;  Punjabi-nain; Burmese - nga-gyin
 <p>
<b>History of use</b> :  The mrigal (<i>Cirrhinus cirrhosus</i>) is the most widely farmed species among the Indian major carps of the Indo-Gangetic floodplains of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  It also found in the rivers of Myanmar that drain into the Bay of Bengal. It is an important component of carp polyculture throughout South Asia. It was introduced for aquaculture, together with catla (<i>Catla catla</i>) and rohu  (<i>Labeo rohita</i>), to other areas of India beyond its natural range in the early 1940's and in the 1950's and 1960's to other Asian countries (Jhingran 1982).
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b> :   There are no reliable statistics on production of mrigal from aquaculture.
 <p>
<b>Where farmed</b> :   Region - South and Southeast Asia, FAO Area - 04, Asia,  Inland.
 <p>
<b>Countries</b>  :  Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
 <p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b> :  Tropics, hardy, can tolerate low oxygen conditions and  salinity levels of 5 ppt; minimum tolerable temperature, 140C; reproduces between 27 - 310C.
 <p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>: Originally, mrigal seed for aquaculture were collected from floodplain rivers or bred by simulating riverine conditions in special ponds called dry bundhs.).  Since 1957, induced breeding technology and large hatcheries have facilitated mass production of seed: for a review of methods, see Jhingran and Pullin (1988).  Mrigal is one of the easiest of the major carps to breed in captivity. <p>
The postlarvae are called renu, dhani or jeera in Bengali and are also commonly called 'spawn'. Postlarvae are usually stocked directly into nursery ponds, raised to advanced fry or fingerlings and then transferred to larger waterbodies. In Bangladesh, mixed postlarvae of mrigal, catla and rohu are stocked in large open waterbodies (haors and beels), from which the fish disperse over vast expanses of water during the annual floods.
 <p>
Mrigal attain first maturity when about two years old  (800 - 1,200 g) and spawn during the south-west monsoon.  The main spawning period is June to August.   In hatcheries, the same fish can spawn two to three times, early in the season.  They lose condition towards the end of the season. The fecundity of mrigal ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 eggs/kg body weight (Jhingran and Khan 1979).
 <p>
For induced spawning, two injections of crude carp pituitary gland  (2-3 mg and  5-8 mg/kg) are given to a female at an interval of 4-6 hrs,  as against only one (2-3 mg/kg) to males at the time of the second injection to the female. a female and two males in a running water spawning task should then spawn within six hours.  If spawning has not taken place, the female is stripped and the eggs fertilized with semen stripped from males. The fertilized eggs hatch after 18-24 hrs depending upon the water temperature. Optimum temperature for spawning and hatching is 280C (Chaudhuri 1963). Jhingran and Pullin (1988) have reviewed the use of materials other than carp pituitary, for induced spawning.
 <p>
Nursery ponds are prepared by liming and fertilization with cover or poultry manure, to produce zooplankton (especially rotifers and small claducerans).  Before stocking the nursery ponds the predators of postlarvae, especially copepods and insects, are controlled with appropriate chemicals (Jhingran and Pullin 1988).  Postlarvae are stocked at 5 million/ha and are given supplementary feed in the form of a fine powder comprising a 1:1 mixture of groundnut/mustard oil cake and rice or wheat bran.  This is given daily at two,  three and four times the weight of postlarvae stocked, increasing the ration at five days intervals. The postlarvae grow to about 25 mm in 15 days, with survival around 70%.
 <p>
The fry are raised in larger rearing ponds which are fertilized in a similar manner to nursery ponds and then normally stocked as part of a combination of catla, rohu and mrigal. The total stocking rate in rearing ponds is usually around 100,00 - 125,000 fry/ha, of which 30-40% are mrigal.  Mrigal is a bottom feeder and consumes mainly detritus and decayed vegetation, along with some plankton (20-25%).
 <p>
Growout ponds (0.2 - 5.0 ha) are stocked with mrigal fingerlings at 10-35% of the total stocking density density depending upon the species mix. In polyculture of Indian major carps (catla, rohu and mrigal), mrigal are normally 30-40%  of the population but this is reduced to 10-15% when common carp are included. Growout ponds are also prepared initially by liming and fertilization with periodic fertilization (organic and inorganic) thereafter. Mrigal normally registers better growth than rohu in ponds that have rich bottom feeding or when supplementary feed is provided regularly. In  sewage-fed ponds, mrigal attain a weight of about 1 kg in 6 months.
 <p>
Several intergeneric hybrids of Indian major carps have been produced in attempts to obtain  faster-growing fish for aquaculture. The best cross so far is that between female mrigal and male rohu, called mrighu. It has a smaller head than rohu and a body deeper than both  parents. It is also fertile.  Such hybrids are also commonly available in the seed from dry bundhs (Tripathi 1992).
 <p>
<b>Processing and marketing</b> :   Mrigal is a tasty fish, despite its fine bones.  It has a good market wherever it is farmed or fished. It is marketed either fresh or packed with ice.
 <p>
<b>Likely future trends</b> :   Mrigal will continue to be a very important species in carp polyculture in Asia. Monoculture of mrigal is not known at present, but the  availability of improved genetic material (such as that being developed in Vietnam) may lead to the development of cage, pen, running water, and closed recirculatory systems, using mrigal alone.  Mrigal is also a good fish for sewage-fed  ponds, where the abundance of  natural food almost high density stocking.

Adults are usually found in open waters along the coast (Ref. 51442). In freshwater, inhabits major rivers but may also enter tributaries, if water  temperature is equal to or is warmer than the main river (Ref. 188, 10536). Known lake populations from Morocco and Portugal need access to rivers to spawn (Refs. 10536, 89647, 89648). Larvae and small juveniles inhabit deep slow-flowing areas of rivers (Ref. 89649), some swimming upstream in late summer and autumn (Ref. 10536). Juveniles (up to 1+ years) are usually found near estuaries or river mouths (Refs. 10536, 59043), possibly making vertical diurnal movements synchronized with the tides; they remain in estuaries for over one year (Ref. 89630). Feeds on a wide range of planktonic crustaceans; larger adults feed on small schooling fishes (Ref. 188, 51442, 59043). Juveniles in freshwater prey on insect larvae. Females in European rivers commonly reach 70 cm total length (Ref. 10536). Females grow faster and are always larger than males of the same age (Ref. 10536). Less common than <i>Alosa fallax</i> but both have suffered from pollution and weirs or other obstructions (Ref. 188). It has been suggested that members of the genus <i>Alosa</i> are hearing specialists with the American shad (<i>Alosa sapidissima</i>) having been found to detect and respond to sounds up to at least 180 kHz (Ref. 89631). This may aid in predator avoidance (e.g. cetaceans) (Ref. 89632).

Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712). Obvious decreasing of the stocks for all the continental native distribution area (Ref. 40476). Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; can be fried, boiled and baked (Ref. 9988).

Found in all rivers where temperature rises above 10° C for about 3 months per year and does not exceed 20° C for more than a few weeks in summer (Ref. 59043) (preferred temperatures 4-12°C). Juveniles may live in cold lakes in northern Europe (Ref. 59043). Parr (i.e. juveniles) are territorial and are found in the upper reaches of rivers and streams, in riffle areas with strong current and rough gravel bottoms (Ref. 7471). During winter, parr seek refuge in small spaces or under stones during the day (Refs. 59043, 89461). Young remain in freshwater for 1 to 6 years, then migrate to coastal marine waters or even to open oceans where they remain for 1 to 4 years before returning to freshwater  for spawning (Ref. 51442). Adults inhabit cooler waters with strong to moderate flow (Ref. 44894). The Atlantic salmon is reported to live up to 10 years, but most individuals only reach 4-6 years (Ref. 88187). Juveniles feed mainly on aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans and fish; adults at sea feed on squids, shrimps, and fish (Ref. 51442). Most populations depend mostly or exclusively on stocking due to degradations of environmental conditions.  Fishing pressure on wild stocks has decreased due to intensive farming but other problems have increased. Farmed salmons escape in large numbers and move to any river and hybridize with wild stocks (Ref. 59043). This species may hybridize with trout (Salmo trutta) (Ref. 59043).

 <p>
The literature on this species has references to three subspecies:  <i>T. ren. rendalli</i>, <i>T. ren. swierstrae</i>, and <i>T. ren. gefuensis</i> (see Thys van den Audenaerde 1968).  These subspecific names are not universally agreed and are not commonly found in the literature on aquaculture of this species.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is one of  a group of several substrate-spawning tilapias that were formerly called ‘<i>Tilapia melanopleura</i>’ by some authors. <i> T. melanopleura</i> is no longer a valid name.  Trewavas (1982) has described the problems caused by previous inaccurate nomenclature of this and related species and listed the characteristics that distinguish <i>T. rendalli</i> from other species which it was sometimes confused.
 <p>
<b>Common Names</b>: Red Breasted Tilapia, Mudile (Tonga), Rooiborskurper (Afrikaans), Chilunguni (Chichewa).
 <p>
<b>History of Use</b>: A popular foodfish throughout subSaharan Africa. Probably first cultured experimentally in Zaïre in the late 1930’s and established in smallholder ponds in that country by 1947. Although now largely abandoned in Zaïre in favor of other species, still widely cultured by African smallholders for subsistence in low-input systems.
 <p>
<b>Production Statistics</b>: 843 tons reported to FAO in 1995 from Malawi, Zambia, Colombia, and Dominican Republic. Other countries that farm this tilapia combine population statistics with those for tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
<b>Where Farmed</b>: West, Central and, particularly, Southern Africa. According to Coche et al (1994), <i>T. rendalli</i> is the fourth most widely cultured species reported in a recent sample of  subSaharan African countries. Countries reporting farmed <i>T. rendalli</i> production are: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
 <p>
<b>Climate and Environmental Tolerance</b>: tropics, can withstand temperatures of 10-40° C. Spawns at temperatures above 20 and of up to at least 30° C. For juveniles, which often forage in very shallow littoral areas, Caulton (1976) demonstrated a temperature preferendum of 35-37° Reported to survive salinities of 13, 18 and 26 ppt.
 <p>
<b>Current Farming Methods</b>: Commercially produced in a cage-based system in Mazvikadei Dam, Zimbabwe; otherwise in small ponds generally of no more than 550 m2. Can support commercial fisheries when stocked into managed reservoirs. Pond inputs are green, leafy materials which are readily eaten by <i>T. rendalli</i> of over 20 g.  Smaller individuals are largely omnivorous.  <i>T. rendalli</i> is a voracious feeder and can consume up to 20% of its body weight per day in fresh green materials. A range of plants suitable for feeding <i>T. rendalli</i> ponds was documented by Chikafumbwa et al. (1991).  Chikafumbwa (1996) found that an input rate of 50 kg dry matter.ha-1.day-1 resulted in optimal performance. Typical specific growth rates at this input rate are between 0.45 and 0.50 % per day. Survival in ponds is normally around 70% as <i>T. rendalli</i> is less hardy and more easily captured by predators than other tilapiine cichlids.
 <p>
Fry production by <i>T. rendalli</i> is considerably less than for the commonly cultured <i>Oreochromis</i> species. Costa-Pierce (1996) reported that, although these fish are substrate spawners, there was no difference between  fry production in tanks with or without sand substrates. Fry production from the 1 male : 2 females (average  weight 40 g) in that study was between 750 and 900 fry per female over 416 days. Brummett (1997) obtained between 3,000 and 5,000 fry of at least 2 g individual weight over a 9 month period in ponds which were seined with a reed fence either every 60 or 30 days, respectively. Brummett and Noble (1995) reported maximum fry production from 200 m2 ponds stocked with 100 male : 100 female broodstock (average weight 50 g) of over 400 fry per female per two week harvesting interval.
 <p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>: In Southern Africa, normally sold whole and fresh on smallholder pond banks.  Splitting and smoking is the preferred method for preservation. Marketed in subSaharan Africa at any size over 50 g.
 <p>
<b>Likely Future Trends</b>: Will remain an important species for farming by smallholders, but could become a more widely farmed commercial species in systems based on  feeding with plant proteins rather than fishmeal. Trials at a commercial farm near Banket, Zimbabwe showed that all-male <i>T. rendalli</i> populations in cages fed with pelleted feeds grew as well as <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under similar conditions.

A marine species which enters estuaries and rivers (Ref. 52331).  Adults occur in small to large schools near the coasts or around islands where reefs are well developed.  Eggs and larvae are pelagic up to 2-3 weeks.  Older larvae migrate onshore and settle in coastal wetlands (mangroves, estuaries) during the juvenile stage, or occasionally enter freshwater lakes.  Juveniles and sub-adults return to sea where they mature sexually.  Spawn only in fully saline water.  Larvae eat zooplankton; juveniles and adults eat cyanobacteria, soft algae, small benthic invertebrates, and even pelagic fish eggs and larvae.  Larvae are collected  from rivers and are grown in culture ponds into juveniles, which are marketed fresh, smoked, canned or frozen.

<p>
<b>Common names</b>: English - milkfish ; Hawaiian - pua awa, awa ; Japanese -  sabahii ; Indonesian - bandeng, golu ; Tagalog (Philippines) - bangus ,  sabalo (for adult fish); 
<p>
<b>History of use</b>: Native to the tropical (and parts of the Northern sub-tropical) Indo-Pacific; used for centuries as a foodfish in Southeast Asia and Oceania; farmed in ponds and coastal enclosures for at least 700 years in Indonesia, 400 in the Philippines and Taiwan and 300 in Hawaii;  farming has been based, until recently, entirely on the capture of wild fry.
<p>
<b>Production statistics</b>: According to FAO (1997) the leading countries in production of farmed milkfish are Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan which produced about 157,000, 151,000 and 63,000 t respectively in 1995.  Production of farmed milkfish occurs on a much smaller scale in some Pacific islands; for example in 1995, Guam 25 t, Kiribati 50 t. Milkfish  production  increased continuously until the late 1980's but declined during early 1990's mainly because of detoriation of spawning grounds (reefs), nursery  grounds (mangrove areas) and fry collecting grounds (sandy coast lines)  (SEAFDEC 1995). Moreover, many pond owners then changed to shrimp farming.
<p>
<b>Where farmed</b>:  Regions - mainly Southeast Asia, FAO Area 04-, Asia, Inland; also to a minor extent Oceania, FAO Areas - 71, 77.
<p>
<b>Countries</b>:   Federated States of Micronesia (Guam), Indonesia, Kiribati, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand.
<p>
<b>Climate and environmental tolerance</b>:  Milkfish, except for spawning adults  and the early larval stages, have very wide ranges of environmental tolerance (Schuster 1960, Gordon and Hong 1986, Bagarinao 1991). Most juvenile stages tolerate low temperatures of 14 to 18 °C and high temperatures of 38 to 41 °C.  In the  Philippines wet season (May to October), milkfish pond temperatures range from 25 to 34°C, salinities from 15 to 25 ppt and dissolved oxygen from 4 to 11 ppm.  In the dry season (November to April) there are similar  fluctuations, but temperatures stay below 30°C from November to December and  peak in February and March, sometimes exceeding 35°C and with concurrent  salinities up to 40 ppt (Juliano 1985; Sumagaysay 1994). Milkfish, except for spawning adults and early land stages, are remarkably euryhaline and tolerate all salinities from freshwater to hypersaline lagoons.  The pH preferred by milkfish is around pH 8.0 and more acidic waters such as ponds that are affected by acid sulphate sorts can depress growth and survival.
<p>
<b>Current farming methods</b>:  Milkfish fry are still mainly caught from shallow inshore waters.  Historically, catches of wild fry have been huge: reaching over 1 billion annually in the Philippines and 700 to 800 million in Indonesia. However, artificial propagation and hatchery operations are being developed to avoid the unpredictable nature of supplies of fry from the wild (Duray 1996).
<p>
During the 1980's, the first spontaneous maturation of hatchery-bred milkfish in captivity was observed after 3.5 to 5.5 years of rearing spawners in net cages (Marte and Lacanilao 1986). Subsequent efforts have been made to induce spawning using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-A).  In the Philippines, hatchery-bred fish have spawned spontaneously in net cages and concrete tanks, producing 50,000 to 956,000 eggs per spawning (Emata 1995). Milkfish farming in Taiwan  is now based almost entirely on hatchery-raised fry. Hatchery production stabilises the supply of fry and can promote increased production of milkfish. A milkfish hatchery needs larval rearing tanks, culture tanks for rotifers (Brachionus) and green algae (Chlorella), and hatching tanks for brine shrimp (Artemia).  Milkfish eggs are collected from broodstock cages and  hatching occurs after 14-16 hours (at 28-29°C) after collection.  Hatching tanks have about 300 eggs per liter for maximum hatching success.  
<p>
To obtain an optimum survival of 30-40%, larval rearing tanks are stocked at a density of 30 larvae per liter, with moderate aeration (23-33°C, 30-40 ppt).   A 'green water' technique is used, with Chlorella added in the morning, before feeding the larvae.  Starting on day 2 until day 21 larvae are fed with rotifers.  From day 15 to day 21, additional <i>Artemia nauplii</i> are added.  Water exchange in the rearing tanks is 30% from day 2 until 14, 50 - 70% from day 15-21. 
<p>
Rearing milkfish larvae to fry also conducted in ponds. Nursery ponds are dried, limed and fertilised with1 to 3 t.ha-1 of chicken manure or  0.5 to 1.0 t.ha-1 of rice bran to develop natural foods.   The water depth is gradually increased to 30 cm before stocking fry at 30 to 50 per m2 (Baliao 1984). Postlarvae begin to feed shortly after the eyes have become fully pigmented and before the yolk is completely resorbed. Unfed larvae all die about 150h from hatching at rearing temperatures of 25 to 27 °C. Postlarvae and fry are particulate, visual feeders on small live prey such as rotifers (Brachionus), cladocerans (Moina), harpacticoid copepods (Tisibintra) and brine shrimp (Artemia). When milkfish larvae are about 2 weeks old, they can take artificial feed.   Milkfish fry from artificial rearing on day 21 are at about the same developmental stages as wild caught fry.
<p>
Fry grow to 5 - 8 cm fingerlings in 4 to 6 weeks. Milkfish fingerlings are day-time feeders and take food mainly from the bottom. The kinds of food  ingested vary with location and fish size. Juveniles from natural habitats feed mainly on cyanobacteria, diatoms and detritus along with filamentous green algae and invertebrates such as small crustaceans and worms. Milkfish  tend to ingest the top layer of bottom sediments, with its associated micro - and meiofauna, as mullet do. Much of this material is detritus, rich in  bacterial protein, fungi, and protozoans.
<p>
Adult milkfish graze on surfaces and on floating algae and, like the juveniles, are opportunistic omnivores.  Growout of milkfish is evolving from traditional low intensity systems in shallow ponds based on natural food supply to more intensive systems in pens and deeper ponds with supplemental feeding  (Fortes 1986, Lee 1995, Kühlmann 1998). The former include the ""lab-lab"" culture system of the Philippines and the shallow water culture ponds of Taiwan. ""Lab-lab"" is a term used in the Philippines for algal mats and their associated biota. Traditional shallow ponds yield around 800 kg ha-1 yr-1 from three crops, whereas more intensive modular ponds can yield up to 200 kg ha-1 yr-1 from six to eight crops.  Using semi-intensive ponds, fertilised with chicken manure (2 to 3 t ha-1) and inorganic fertilisers (100 kg ha-1 ammonia phosphate, 10 kg ha-1 urea) and stocking densities up to 7,000 fish ha-1 in combination with  supplemental feeding at 4 % body weight have yielded 1,160 kg ha-1 per crop (Sumagaysay and Borlongan 1995). In the Philippines, growth rates are much higher in the wet season than in the dry season  (Kühlmann 1998).  Adult milkfish spawners can be kept on a diet of commercial pellets with about 42 % protein, given at 1.5 to 2 % of body weight twice daily, presented on a feeding tray.
<p>
Milkfish are normally farmed in monoculture but there is some polyculture to utilise ecological food niches more efficiently e.g. with crustaceans (<i>Penaeus indicus</i>, <i>Penaeus monodon</i>, <i>Scylla serrata</i>) or fish (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>; <i>Megalops cyprinoides</i>) (Eldani and Primavera 1981; Fortes 1984).
<p>
<b>Processing and Marketing</b>:   The preferred market size for milkfish in Asia is  about 300 - 400 g, meaning fish of less than one year old.  Milkfish do not  reach sexual maturity until 5 - 7 years of age.  Milkfish is mainly sold  whole, fresh or frozen.  It has very limited market acceptability outside  the main countries for production, because of its many fine bones.  Producers of milkfish do not usually sell fish directly to consumers, but  instead deliver fish through co-operatives, brokers, dealers, collectors or  wholesalers, and retailers. The majority are sold at auctions, through  dealers, brokers, wholesalers or co-operatives to other dealers, and then to  retailers.  Milkfish are also processed by marinating, smoking, or canning  for export to Asian minorities; for example, to the USA.
<p>
<b>Likely future trends</b>:  The introduction of milkfish hatchery technology  will continue to have a positive net economic impact on farmed milkfish production, employment, and income, while removing the livelihoods of some wild fry collectors. Moreover, if the production efficiency of intensive and semi-intensive (Focken and Becker 1996) systems can be improved, farmed milkfish production is likely to increase. There is also scope for wider consumption of value-added products, such as canned milkfish.

They feed in shallow (0.5-1.0 m deep) and warm (over 21°C) backwaters, lakes and flooded areas with slow current on phytoplankton and zooplankton (Ref. 30578, 10294).  Bigger individuals from about 1.5 cm SL feed only on phytoplankton while larvae and small juveniles prey on zooplankton (Ref. 59043).  Adults breed in rivers or tributaries over shallow rapids with gravel or sand bottom, in upper water layer or even at surface during floods when the water level increases by 50-120 cm above normal level.  Conditions for spawning include high current (0.5-1.7 m/s), turbid water, temperatures above 15°C (usually 18-26°C)  and high oxygen concentrations (Ref. 59043).  Spawning ceases if conditions change (especially sensitive to water-level fall) and resumes again when water level increases.  Juveniles and adults form large schools during spawning season.  Mature individuals undertake long distance upriver migration at start of a rapid flood and water-level increase, able to leap over obstacles up to 1 m.  After spawning, adults migrate to foraging habitats,  In autumn, adults move to deeper places in main course of river where they remain without feeding.  Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current (Ref. 59043).  In aquaculture, it can survive brackish water (up to 7 ppt) when released into estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 59043).  Escape from fish farms are widely known even as they are stocked in large rivers and almost all still water bodies like lakes and ponds.

Enters rivers in shoals to spawn (Ref. 4779). Spends 6-8 years at sea before maturing and returning to rivers in June - July, to spawn in September - October of same year. A second run in autumn; those fishes remain a year in rivers before spawning. Moves far upstream, sometimes our to 1500 km. Spawns in shallow tributaries with some current in well oxygenated water over gravel bottom. Individual females do not spawn every year; spawns only 2-3 times during entire life. After spawning adults return directly to sea. Embryonic development lasts up to 7 months. Alevins migrate downstream in May - June (Ref. 59043). Collected by fyke nets (Ref. 4526).

Adults start upstream migration in late July - August and reach spawning sites by October - November and spawn in stretches with swift current and sand-pebble bottom, often under ice. Spawning lasts 5-7 days and fish leave spawning site soon after, migrating downstream to overwinter in deeper places of lower stretches of rivers together with older juveniles. In spring, alevins drift from spawning sites downstream with flood-water and forage in floodplain lakes and oxbows where they remain until end of summer before moving to river or reaching maturity (if lakes are large enough and do not dry out).
